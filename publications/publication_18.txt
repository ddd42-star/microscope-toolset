ABSTRACT: The discovery of bioactive natural products remains a
time-consuming and challenging task. The ability to link high-
conﬁdence metabolite annotations in crude extracts with activity
would be highly beneﬁcial to the drug discovery process. To address
this challenge, HPLC-based activity proﬁling and advanced UHPLC-
HRMS/MS metabolite pro ﬁling for annotation were combined to
leverage the information obtained from both approaches on a crude
extract scaled down to the submilligram level. This strategy was applied
to a subset of an extract library screening aiming to identify natural
products inhibiting oncogenic signaling in melanoma. Advanced
annotation and data organization enabled the identiﬁcation of
compounds that were likely responsible for the activity in the extracts.
These compounds belonged to two diﬀerent natural product scaﬀolds, namely, brevipolides from aHyptis brevipes extract and
methoxylated ﬂavonoids identiﬁed in three diﬀerent extracts of Hyptis and Artemisia spp. Targeted isolation of these prioritized
compounds led toﬁve brevipolides and seven methoxylatedﬂavonoids. Brevipolide A (1) and 6-methoxytricin (9) were the most
potent compounds from each chemical class and displayed AKT activity inhibition with an IC50 of 17.6 ± 1.6 and 4.9± 0.2 μM,
respectively.
N
atural products are a proli ﬁc source of new drugs.
However, the path from an active extract of an organism
to a promising active compound is a time-consuming and
challenging process which is negatively aﬀecting the overall
interest for natural products in drug discovery.1,2
Technologies and methodologies have been developed to
address these shortcomings.3 In the early 2000s, implementa-
tion of preformatted libraries4,5 and development of hyphen-
ated techniques6 and new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
probe technologies7 have accelerated signiﬁcantly the discov-
ery of bioactive compounds in extracts. This allowed the use of
HPLC-SPE-NMR combined with inhibition proﬁling, for the
discovery of bioactive compounds in plant extracts.8
More recently, advanced metabolomic tools, such as
molecular networking (MN) implemented in global natural
product social molecular networking (GNPS), 9 have been
established as a drug discovery approach.10 MN is based on
MS fragmentation spectra, which are then linked together on
the basis of their similarity. The development of this workﬂow,
driven by a collective eﬀort of academic groups, enables the
visualization of features associated with metabolites present in
complex extracts and is now used for targeted discovery of
natural products.11 Moreover, signiﬁcant progress has been
made in the structural annotation of such networks. 12
Together with new natural products-oriented chemical
classiﬁcation methods, 13 more advanced approaches allow
the classiﬁcation of unknown metabolites based on their MS
fragmentation spectra.14 Complementing this annotation with
conﬁdence scores15,16 further increases the relevance of such
annotations.
By interrogating the molecular network, it is possible to
explore the chemical diversity present in an extract and to
pinpoint compounds of interest for subsequent isolation. One
possibility is to focus on a given biological activity and to look
for corresponding features in the data set. Clusters containing
features either predicted as biologically active or already
reported as active can then be highlighted as potentially
interesting, since they most likely include structural analogues

that may also be active. This strategy has been used
successfully to isolate new analogues of known active
compounds.17,18 While the network can be used to target
biologically active compounds, another way to use it is to
discover structural novelty.
An extract-based activity annotation was recently reported
by Litaudon and co-workers,19 whereby the MN was based on
analytical data and activity of extracts only. In this case, a large
data set of closely related extracts (292 extracts from diﬀerent
Euphorbiaceae spp., 20 genera, 107 species) enabled the
targeted isolation of speciﬁc features on their putative antiviral
potential and structural novelty.
A fraction-based activity annotation of the MN has been
recently reported. For exam ple, Liang and co-workers
developed a workﬂow where four active extracts from the
family Papaveraceae were fractionated on an analytical scale.
Fractions were analyzed by LC-CAD-HRMS/MS and tested
for biological activities, and a MN was built with this
qualitative, semiquantitative, and bioactivity information.20 A
similar approach was used by Dorrestein and co-workers to
identify the deoxyphorbol esters responsible for the antiviral
activity in an extract ofEuphorbia dendroides.21 In this case, the
extract was ﬁrst fractionated on a preparative scale, and each
fraction was analyzed and tested. Results obtained from the
fractions were added to the network. In these two examples,
the MN was built on the basis of data obtained from the
fractions and not from the extract. Linking relevant biological
activity with features directly in crude extracts would enable an
activity-driven approach which, in turn, would signiﬁcantly
accelerate the discovery process.
HPLC-based activity proﬁling has been used routinely for
multiple drug discovery projects since the early 2000s. 22
Depending on the assay type, microgram to submilligram
amounts of extract are submitted to a time-based fractionation.
The activity of these fractions is then combined with HPLC
chromatograms to obtain so-called“HPLC-based activity
proﬁles”. Thus, activity can be assigned to discrete fractions/
peaks.
To enable the annotation of peaks of interest and to
eﬃciently link these annotated peaks with an activity, the
workﬂow presented herein combines HPLC-based activity
proﬁling with UHPLC-HRMS/MS metabolite annotation to
exploit the full potential of both approaches. This resulted in a
multilayered MN that was used for the eﬃcient prioritization
of two classes of compounds inhibiting AKT activity in human
melanoma cells. The prioritized compounds were isolated and
tested as active, thus validating the workﬂow utilized.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Establishment of Workﬂow for Eﬃcient Prioritization
of Active Features. To investigate the combination of
HPLC-based activity proﬁling and advanced UHPLC-HRMS/
MS metabolite proﬁling, eight extracts from a recent plant-
based drug discovery project were chosen.23 Thus, an extract
library consisting of over 2500 plant extracts was screened
using a scalable high-content screening (HCS) assay that
quantiﬁes inhibition of oncogenic ERK (extracellular signal-
regulated kinase) and AKT (AK strain transforming kinase)
activity in melanoma cells. As outlined inFigure 1A, two active
extracts originating from Artemisia argyi H. Lév. & Vaniot
(Asteraceae) and Hyptis brevipes Poit. (Lamiaceae) were
selected, together with six in active extracts from other
Artemisia and Hyptis species. Inclusion of active and inactive
extracts of related species is regarded as important in the study
design since (1) species belonging to the same genus are more
likely to produce similar compounds,24 (2) speciﬁc features
responsible for bioactivity should be easier to highlight among
species based on comparison of proﬁling data within the same
genus, and (3) annotation conﬁdence is improved by including
well-studied species within the genus, with multiple com-
pounds already known. All eight extracts were thus submitted
to both HPLC-UV-ELSD activity proﬁling and UHPLC-
HRMS/MS metabolite pro ﬁling ( Figure 1 B,C). The MN
obtained on the whole extract data set allowed the organization
of the data and to establish links between the extracts and the
annotation with diﬀerent information types, such as
dereplicated structures, corresponding natural product classes,
the activity of the extracts, and the activity of the micro-
fractions (Figure 1D). In this manner, some clusters of interest
were prioritized (Figure 1E) for scale-up isolation, and the
activity of the compounds was conﬁrmed subsequently after
isolation.
HCS Assay on Melanoma Cells and Activity of
Extracts. The HCS assay used throughout this study aimed
to identify natural products that target aberrant oncogenic
signaling states in melanoma. A patient-derived MM121224
cell line that harborsBRAF V600E andNRAS Q61K mutations
leading to aberrant proliferation through constitutive activation
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AK strain transforming kinase
(PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracel-
lular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway was
used.25 Cells were engineered to express genetically encoded
kinase translocation reporters (KTR) that report simulta-
neously on ERK (ERK-KTR) and AKT (AKT-KTR) activity.
In the absence of ERK/AKT activity, the KTR sensors localize
to the nucleus of cells, whereas when ERK/AKT activity is
high, the KTR sensors get phosphorylated and shuttle to the
cytosol in a reversible fashion. Since ERK- and AKT-KTR are
labeled with diﬀerent ﬂuorophores, multiplexed single-cell
measurements are possible. The activation status of each kinase
can be measured by a ratio of cytosolic versus nucleus
ﬂuorescence intensities.26 ,27 Finally, an automated image
analysis pipeline that enables the analysis of large volumes of
images was used to process the data, as described in an earlier
paper.23 This HCS pipeline was used initially to screen 2576
plant extracts.
Eight extracts were selected on the basis of the AKT activity
on MM121224 cells obtained from this previous screen and, as
described before, included two active and six inactive extracts.
These extracts were again submitted for biological testing. The
AKT activity is reported as normalized percentage inhibition
(NPI), where an NPI≤ 0.4 was considered as strongly active.
A NPI between 0.4 and 0.7 was considered as moderately
active and values above as inactive. As expected, extracts from
H. brevipesas well as A. argyi exhibited strong inhibition of
AKT activity with NPIs of 0.06 and 0.08, respectively. In
contrast to the previous screen, extracts fromHyptis brachiata
Briq. (Lamiaceae) and Hyptis verticillata Jacq. (Lamiaceae)
showed moderate activity. The other four extracts were
inactive (Table S1, Supporting Information). As all extracts
were inactive on the ERK pathway (data not shown), in the
following workﬂow only the AKT activity was considered.
HPLC-Based Activity Proﬁling. Selected extracts were
submitted to analytical HPLC-based activity proﬁling (Figure
1B, left). The amount of extract and HPLC method used to
obtain microfractions were adapted to bestﬁt the assay format

and assay type. In the present work, a submilligram amount of
crude extract was fractionated by analytical HPLC in 24
fractions that were tested in the HCS assay. The HPLC-based
activity proﬁle of H. brevipes extract (Figure 2) indicated four
active fractions (activity on AKT in MM121224 cells). Strong
and moderate inhibition of AKT activity was also observed in
the fractions ofH. brachiataand A. argyiextracts (Figures S2−
S5, Supporting Information). However, fractions of H.
verticillata extract were inactive (Figures S6−S7, Supporting
Information). All inactive extracts remained inactive at the
fraction level (data not shown). The activity-based information
obtained at the fraction level could then be used to annotate
the MN (Figure 1D III).
HPLC-UHPLC-MS/MS Geometrical Chromatographic
Gradient Transfer. In order to link the “HPLC-based
bioactivity data” with “UHPLC metabolite pro ﬁling data”
both chromatographic methods had to be precisely correlated.
For this, the HPLC conditions were optimized to ideallyﬁt the
activity testing purposes and were taken as the starting point
for the geometrical chromatographic gradient transfer to
UHPLC (Figure 1B), as described by Guillarme et al. 28
HPLC and UHPLC stationary phases were the same to ensure
ideal transfer. To avoid small inaccuracies, particularly at the
beginning of the gradient, retention times were normalized
between the ﬁrst and last observed peaks. This resulted in
HPLC fraction times transferable to the UHPLC conditions,
thus avoiding a systematic analysis of all fractions on the
UHPLC platform. An example of such transferred retention
time windows is shown in Figure S6 and S7 (Supporting
Information). After this was done, the activity of the fractions
was mapped on the corresponding normalized retention time
window of the UHPLC run.
UHPLC-MS/MS Data Organization and Usage for
Prioritization. The UHPLC-PDA-CAD-HRMS/MS data
was treated with MZmine using the recently introduced ion
identity.29 It was then processed through the GNPS to lead to
a hybrid MN containing both MS1 and MS2 information to
organize the data.
The network obtained is shown in Figure 3A. Clustering
parameters were adapted to maintain maximum connectivity
between nodes, thus maximizing information. Further details
can be found in the relatedExperimental Section. Features
were, in parallel, annotated with taxonomic, structural, and
bioactivity information. The annotation of the features with
biological information was made through the calculated
retention time window. All features were informed with a
reﬁned NPI value, as described in theExperimental Section,
allowing a more precise selection of features to prioritize.
Features annotated with an NPI value <0.7 were considered as
active and were prioritized. Edges to nonactive features were
discarded (Figure 3B), and the MN was reorganized according
to remaining edges (Figure 3C). The advanced annotation of
the MN is illustrated inFigure 3D. As all analytical runs were
acquired in the same batch, the source organism(s) of the
feature could be attributed to those in the extract where the
three most intense signals were found.
The entire processing and data organization were performed
to rationally reduce features/data dimension to a meaningful
subset that allows expert evaluations for prioritization. Out of
214 features that were linked to an interesting NPI value
(≤0.4), 80 belonged to clusters with at least four features
(Figure 3 C). These clusters were annotated mainly as
brevipolides, ﬂavonoids, triterpenoi ds, diterpenoids, and
sesquiterpenoids (mainly sesquiterpene lactones).
The two larger clusters, clusters 1 and 2, were analyzed and
annotated in more depth (Figure 4). Cluster 1 did contain
features belonging to mainly one extract, and these features
were annotated as being very active (highlighted in pink). On
the other hand, cluster 2 displayed features from di ﬀerent
extracts, suggesting the presence of less taxon-speci ﬁc
compounds associated with an activity. Best-candidate
structures coming from the GNPS and ISDB-LOTUS 30,31
complemented with pairs coming from the Dictionary of
Natural Products are reported. Details concerning the
candidate taxonomically informed weighting, are provided in
the Experimental Section.
In cluster 1, features were present almost exclusively inH.
brevipes. Their activity scores were the highest among all
features, and they could be annotated as brevipolides,
described earlier fromH. brevipes .32−34 Interestingly, a
diterpenoid with abietane skeleton reported previously from
H. dilatata 35 was also annotated in the middle of the
brevipolide cluster. In total, with stereoisomers, four of the
annotated structures in cluster 1 were conﬁrmed by later
isolation (see related section).

In cluster 2, nodes with the highest activity score again were
found mainly inH. brevipes, but some other related nodes also
exhibiting reasonable activity occurred in A. argyi and H.
brachiata. All annotated nodes were methoxylatedﬂavonoids,
with the exception of an anthraquinone derivative coming from
the GNPS library (CCMSLIB00006422349). Based on the
structure, it was possible to see the structural moiety of the
anthraquinone leading to similar fragments as the methoxy-
latedﬂavonoids to explain this inconsistency. Among the
methoxylated ﬂavonoids cluster, only one structure was
annotated correctly. The di ﬃculty of correct identi ﬁcation
lay in determining the exact positions of the methoxylated
group of theseﬂavonoids, which do not lead to signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the corresponding fragmentation spectra. As an
example, 6-methoxytricin ( 9), isolated in this work, was
annotated as an isomer that had only one small modiﬁcation
among its substituents. Compound9 has one methoxy moiety
at C-3′ and one hydroxy group at C-4′. However, the position
of these substituents was inverted in the annotated feature.
Some of the annotated methoxylatedﬂavonoids were already
reported either in H. brevipes ,32 A. argyi ,36−41 or related
Artemisia species.42
Annotations were highly consistent within both the
brevipolide and methoxylated ﬂavonoid molecular families,
and so isolation eﬀorts were focused on those active labeled
features. Tabulations detailing prioritized features are available
inTables S2 and S3(Supporting Information), together with
related extracted ion chromatograms ( Figures S16 −S18,
Supporting Information).

EtOAc extract ofH. brevipes and isolated as compounds1−7.
Their planar structures were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy
and identiﬁed on the basis of comparison with literature values
as brevipolide A (1),32 brevipolide B (2),32 brevipolide C
(3),32 brevipolide F ( 4),32 brevipolide G ( 5),33,43 3,7-
dimethylquercetagetin (6),44 and chrysosplenol C (7).45 The
isolated brevipolides (1−5) have been previously reported in
H. brevipes,32,33 but, to the best of our knowledge, the two
ﬂavonoids 6 and 7 are new to the genusHyptis.
Additional methoxylated ﬂavonoids were annotated in H.
brachiata and A. argyi. A scale-up extract of H. brachiata
aﬀorded sideritoﬂavone (8),46 which already has been reported
from other Hyptis species.47−49
One fraction, namely, fraction N, obtained in a previous
investigation on A. argyi,50 was determined as containing
mainly ﬂavonoids. Further puriﬁcation of this fraction led to
the isolation of compounds9−12. These were identiﬁed as 6-
methoxytricin ( 9), jaceosidin ( 10), eupatilin ( 11), and
chrysosplenetin (12). All compounds are known as constitu-
ents of A. argyi, except for 6-methoxytricin, which was so far
reported only in otherArtemisia species (Chart 1).51−54
Absolute Conﬁgurations of Brevipolides.The absolute
conﬁguration (AC) for brevipolides A −G was established
previously as 5R,6 S,7 S,9 S using a combination of NOESY,
ECD, and Mosher’s method, without being able to resolve the
AC at C-11.32 This was later established as 11S by X-ray
crystallography and hydrogenation for brevipolides H and I.
The AC of all other brevipolides was suggested to be the same
at C-11 considering similarity in experimental and theoretical
NMR and ECD data.33 However, the calculated spectra of
both C-11 epimers had not been studied. We, therefore,
compared the experimental ECD spectra to ab initio calculated

reference spectra of both epimers at C-11 to assign the
conﬁgurations.
The main diﬀerence between the experimental spectra of
trans- and cis-brevipolides in their ECD was the sign of the
band around 300 nm (representative examples are shown in
Figure 5) as described earlier. 33 In addition, experimental
ECDs of both trans- and cis-brevipolides show a negative
Cotton eﬀect (CE) around 228 nm and a positive CE at 260
nm.
The ECD spectra of both C-11 epimers oftrans- and cis-
brevipolides were calculated (Figures 5 and S20, S22, S24,
Supporting Information). In all trans- brevipolides, the
calculated spectra of the 11S-epimers typically showed negative
CEs at 228 nm and positive CEs at 260 nm. Moreover, the
spectra displayed a positive or no signiﬁcant CE at 300 nm
(Figures 5 Aa n d S20, S24 , Supporting Information). In
contrast, the calculated spectra of all 11R-epimers did exhibit
a positive CE at 260, no negative CE at 228 nm, and in
brevipolides A and G an additional positive CE at 275 nm.
Moreover, they showed a distinct negative CE around 300 nm.
As the calculated CE at 300 nm was very distinct for both C-11
epimers, the assignment of the 11S-conﬁguration could be
deﬁned clearly for thetrans-brevipolides A (1), C (3), and G
(5).
For the two cis-brevipolides, no clear conclusion could be
reached, as the diﬀerences between the calculated spectra were
much less pronounced or virtually nonexistent (Figures 5B and
S22, Supporting Information). A reason could be the negative
CE at 300 nm, which was previously described as typical for
cis-brevipolides, and coincides with the negative CE around
300 nm calculated for all 11R epimers.33 Thus, ECD was not
suited to assign the ACs at C-11 forcis-brevipolides B (2) and
F( 4). However, as all 13C NMR shifts for C-11 are very
similar, this suggests a commonS-conﬁguration at this position
for all compounds.
Activity of Isolated Compounds. While only AKT
activity readouts were considered for MN analysis, the results
of both ERK and AKT activity in response to the isolated
compounds were determined.
All brevipolides exhibited a strong concentration-dependent
inhibition of AKT activity, whereas the ERK activity was, as
expected, less a ﬀected ( Figure 6 ,a n d S25, Supporting
Information). However, at the highest concentration of 200

μM (100μM for brevipolide A,1), lower cell numbers, as well
as rounding up of the cells were observed, indicating cell
toxicity. Among these compounds, brevipolide A (1) was the
most potent with a relative IC50 of 17.6 ± 1.6 μM on AKT
(Figure 6). The IC50 values for2−5 were determined as 32.9±
3.4, 61.7 ± 9.6, 53.5 ± 9.9, and 32.3± 5.6 μM against AKT,
respectively. There were no IC50 values determined for ERK in
the MM121224 cells used, because no plateau was reached at
200μM (respectively, 100μM).
Brevipolides A (1), B (2), F (4), and G (5) were reported
previously to be cytotoxic against di ﬀerent cancer cells.
Brevipolide C (3) is known to inhibit the proteasome, while
brevipolide G reportedly inhibits NF-κB.32 An updated study
of brevipolide pharmacology was published recently, in which
brevipolide H was examined. With a methoxy group instead of
a hydroxy group at C-4′, brevipolide H is closely related to
brevipolide G. In this report, brevipolide H was shown to
reduce AKT activity using Western-blot experiments.55 The
inhibitory activity of brevipolides A−C, F, G (1−5) on AKT
signaling support these earlierﬁndings on brevipolide H.
The most activeﬂavonoid 9 had an IC50 value of 4.9± 0.2
μM, whereas compounds8, 10, 11 were also active at a low
μM range (27.9 ± 2.8, 11.1 ± 1.1, and 20.9 ± 2.7 μM,
respectively) (Figures 6, S28, and S29, Supporting Informa-
tion). For the less active compounds6, 7, and 12, which all
bear a methoxy group at C-3, a 100% inhibition was not
reached (Figure S28 and S29, Supporting Information). Within
the series of methoxylatedﬂavonoids, it was theﬁrst time that
compounds 8 and 9 were identiﬁed as downregulating AKT
activity in melanoma. Previous studies have suggested that
eupatilin (11) speci ﬁcally inhibits PI3K kinase, 56 and
phosphorylated AKT was shown to be decreased in jaceosidin
treated cells.57 The general potential ofﬂavonoids in inhibiting
the phosphorylation of AKT was studied in a screen of 44
phenolic compounds, where 26 compounds showed activity via
ELISA and Western blot experiments.58 Furthermore, it is
interesting to mention that a morpholine-containing small
molecule, compound LY294002, developed as an ATP
competitive inhibitor of PI3K enzymes, was derived from the
basic structure of aﬂavonoid (quercetin).59 These examples
highlight the potential ofﬂavonoids as PI3K/AKT inhibitors.
■ CONCLUSION
The main goal of the current work was to investigate how
HPLC-based activity proﬁling can be rationally combined with
advanced UHPLC-HRMS/MS metabolite pro ﬁling. The
workﬂow developed here allowed data organization and
annotation to e ﬃciently link activity with compounds
contained in crude extracts, thereby facilitating the prioritiza-
tion of features for scale-up isolation of active natural products.
The tagging of bioactive features present in crude extracts was
conﬁrmed by the isolation of two classes of compounds that
were subsequently tested as active.
The miniaturization and scalability of the HCS platform
provided the necessary throughput to eﬃciently characterize
the antioncogenic ERK/AKT activity of a range of compound
analogues. Thus, brevipolides A −C, F, G ( 1−5) were all
shown to downregulate AKT, a ﬁnding that is in line with
results obtained with Western blot on the related brevipolide
H.55 This example highlights the advantages of HCS assays in
the context of library screening and rapid characterization of
compound series.
By combining activity proﬁling with advanced annotation,
information obtained by each of the approaches could be
leveraged. On the one side, the activity-proﬁling approach
provides activity data at the microfraction level, thereby
improving the quality of the annotation. In comparison to an
extract-based activity annotation, the number of features being
active is signiﬁcantly reduced. This advanced annotation even
allowed the identiﬁcation of an active methoxylatedﬂavonoid
from H. brachiata which would not have been identiﬁed as
active by using the activity proﬁling approach alone.
Nevertheless, some of the limitations inherent to each
approach will remain. Activity proﬁling will still be aﬀected, for
example, by peaks eluting in two adjacent fractions. Moreover,
feature annotation could be biased by the over-representation
of compound classes already well described, both structurally
and for their activity.60
Since metabolite and activity proﬁling both allow for high
throughput, lowering it to medium throughput appears as a
good compromise between speed and data quality. Longer LC
gradient times, for example, allow for better discrimination of
isomers, better peak shapes, and more accurate gradient
transfer. This also aﬀords more fractions for bioactivity testing,
allowing better localization of the activity within an extract.
While slightly increasing experimental time, this undoubtedly
leads to better prioritization of active features, and later
validation of the predicted active features.
Finally, while the presented results were obtained in a screen
for natural products inhibiting oncogenic signaling in
melanoma, the developed methodology can be used with any
modern bioassay pipelines that allow for both miniaturization
and scalability. It is expected also that this workﬂow will be
useful when trying to better understand an observed activity
resulting from a complex extract. This is of great importance
for natural products drug discovery, as highlighted here, and
also of great potential for the identiﬁcation of active principles
in phytomedicines, and for the rapidly growing ﬁelds of
nutraceuticals and cosmetics containing plant derived com-
pounds.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
General Experimental Procedures.UV and ECD spectra were
recorded in MeOH (66.6 −133.3 μg/mL) on a Chirascan CD
spectrometer using 1 mm-path precision cells (110 QS, Hellma
Analytics, Müllheim, Germany). NMR spectra were recorded on a
Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz for
1H and 125.77 MHz for13C nuclei.1H NMR, COSY, HSQC, HMBC,
and NOESY spectra were measured at 23°C in a 1 mm TXI or a 5
mm BBO probe. Spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, U.S.A.), acetone-d, or DMSO-d6 (both Armar Chemicals,
Döttingen, Switzerland). Bruker TopSpin 3.5 and ACD/Laboratories
NMR Workbook suites softwares were used to process the data.

Chemical shifts are reported asδ values (ppm), with residual signal as
internal reference, J in Hz.
HPLC-grade solvents MeOH, CH 3CN (Avantor, Radnor, PA,
U.S.A.) and water from a Milli-Q water puriﬁcation system (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, U.S.A.) were used for HPLC separation. HPLC-
grade formic acid (FA) and DMSO were obtained from Scharlau
(Scharlab S.L., Spain). For extraction and silica gel column
chromatography, technical-grade n-hexane, EtOAc, and MeOH and
HPLC-grade CHCl3 were used (Rheuss Chemie, Tägerig, Switzer-
land). Normal-phase ﬂash chromatography was carried out on a
Puriﬂash 4100 system (Interchim, Montluçon, France) consisting of a
pump, a UV detector and fraction collector. Silica gel 60 (15−40 μm
to pack column; 63−200 μm for dry loading) was obtained from
Merck. TLC analysis was performed on silica gel 60 F254 coated
aluminum TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Detection
occurred at UV 254 and 366 nm, and after spraying with 1% ethanolic
vanillin and 10% sulfuric acid in EtOH, followed by heating (10 min;
110 °C). Preparative HPLC separation was carried out on a 1290
Inﬁnity II Preparative LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, U.S.A.) consisting of a binary pump connected to a PDA
and to a single quadrupole MS detector via a T-splitter. A SunFire
Prep C18 OBD column (5μm, 30 × 150 mm i.d., Waters, Milford,
MA, U.S.A.) equipped with a C18 Prep guard column (10× 30 mm
i.d.) was used. Theﬂow rate was 20 mL/min. Semipreparative HPLC
was carried out on a HP 1100 Series system (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, U.S.A.) consisting of a binary pump, an autosampler, and
a DAD or on an Alliance HPLC system 2690 (Waters, Milford, MA,
U.S.A.) equipped with a DAD 996 detector (Waters). Separations
were carried out at a ﬂow rate of 4 mL/min. The following
semiseparative RP-HPLC columns were used: SunFire Prep C 18
column (5 μm, 10 × 150 mm i.d., Waters, Milford, MA, U.S.A.)
equipped with a guard column (10× 10 mm i.d.) forH. brevipesand
A. argyiand a ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ column (3μm, 10× 150 mm
i.d., Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) and forH.
brachiata.
Microfractionation and analytical HPLC-PDA-ELSD-ESIMS (for
activity pro ﬁles) were carried out on a LC-MS 8030 system
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of degasser, binary high-pressure
mixing pump, autosampler, column oven, and PDA detector. A triple
quadrupole MS and an ELSD 3300 detector (Alltech, Deerﬁeld, IL,
U.S.A.) were connected via a T-splitter to the system. The mobile
phases contained 0.1% FA. An XBridge C18 (3.5 μm, 3.0 × 150 mm
i.d.) column equipped with a VanGuard precolumn (3.5μm, 2.1 mm
× 5 mm i.d.) (both Waters, Milford, MA, U.S.A.) was used.
UHPLC analysis was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC
system (Waters, Milford, MA, U.S.A.) with photodiode array (PDA)
(Waters) interfaced to a Q-Exactive Focus mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) and a Charged Aerosol
Detector (CAD) (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) using a
heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source. Thermo Scientiﬁc
Xcalibur 3.1 software with SII and speciﬁc drivers for CAD were used
for instrument control. The mass analyzer was calibrated using a
mixture of ca ﬀeine, methionine−arginine−phenylalanine−alanine−
acetate (MRFA), sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium taurocholate, and
Ultramark 1621 in a CH3CN/MeOH/H2O solution containing 1%
FA by direct injection. The data-dependent MS/MS events were
performed on the three most intense ions detected in full-scan MS
(Top3 experiment). The MS/MS isolation window width was 1.5 Da,
and the stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) was set to 15, 30,
and 45 units. In data-dependent MS/MS experiments, full scans were
acquired at a resolution of 35,000 fwhm (atm/z 200) and MS/MS
scans at 17,500 fwhm both with a maximum injection time of 119 ms
and 55 ms, respectively. After being acquired in a MS/MS scan,
parent ions were placed in a dynamic exclusion list for 2.0 s. Di-
isooctyl phthalate C24H38O4 [M + H]+ ion (m/z 391.28429) was used
as an internal lock mass. The optimized HESI-II parameters for the
long runs were as follows: source voltage, 3.5 kV (positive); sheath gas
ﬂow rate (N2), 38 units; auxiliary gasﬂow rate, 10 units; auxiliary gas
temperature, 266 °C; sweep gas ﬂow rate, 1 unit; capillary
temperature, 250 °C; S-Lens RF Level, 45. For short runs: source
voltage, 3.5 kV (positive); sheath gas ﬂow rate (N 2), 45 units;
auxiliary gas ﬂow rate, 10 units; auxiliary gas temperature, 400°C;
sweep gasﬂow rate, 2 units; capillary temperature, 250°C; S-Lens RF
Level, 45. Separation was achieved on an Acquity BEH C18 column
(2.1 × 50 mm I.D.; 1.7μm) (Waters) for the short runs, and on an
Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm I.D.; 1.7μm) (Waters),
both equipped with a precolumn of 5 mm of the same phase. The
temperature in the autosampler and column oven wasﬁxed at 10 and
40 °C, respectively. The mobile phase consisted of water (A) and
CH3CN (B) both containing 0.1% FA; separation was performed with
a linear gradient from 5 to 100% of B in 3.42 min with an initial hold
of 0.17 min at 5% followed by a 1 min isocratic step at 100% of B and
then a 1 min isocratic step at 5% of B for column reconditioning. For
long runs, separation was performed with a linear gradient from 5 to
100% of B in 59.00 min with an initial hold of 1.18 min at 5%
followed by a 17 min isocratic step at 100% of B and then an 11 min
isocratic step at 5% of B for column reconditioning. The injection
volume was set at 2μL for both runs, and theﬂow rates wereﬁxed at
0.6 mL/min and 0.4 mL/min, respectively. A PDA was used to
acquire UV spectra detected from 200 to 500 nm. The CAD
evaporation temperature was set at 40°C, with 5 bar N2, and power
function 1, and a data collection rate of 20 Hz with a 0.5 sﬁlter
constant. The analyticalﬂow splitter was an ASI 610 Series and was
set to 62, which corresponded to a 2:1 ratio (CAD:MS).
Plant Material. Hyptis brevipes aerial parts were collected in San
Antonio (Panama) in November 1990, by the Centro de
Investigaciones Farmacognosticas de la Flora Panamena (CIFLOR-
PAN).Hyptis brachiata aerial parts were collected in the area of El
Pinar, CocléProvince (Panama) by CIFLORPAN. The taxonomic
identity of H. brevipes and H. brachiata was conﬁrmed by Alex
Espinosa, a botanist at CIFLORPAN, and voucher specimens are
deposited at the Herbarium of the University of Panama (H. brevipes
ground plant material, no. 1183;H. brachiata, no. 391). The material
was dried and ground in Panama. Voucher specimens are also
available at the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, Department of
Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel (no. 1183; 1181).

Microfractionation and Activity Proﬁles. The following EtOAc
extracts (10 mg/mL in DMSO) from an in-house library were
microfractionated and tested:H. brachiata (Lamiaceae), H. brevipes
(Lamiaceae), Hyptis capitata Jacq. (Lamiaceae), H. verticillata (syn.
Condea verticillata (Jacq.) Harley & J.F.B. Pastore) (Lamiaceae),
Artemisia absinthium L. (Asteraceae), A. argyi (Asteraceae), Artemisia
scoparia Waldst. & Kit. (Asteraceae), and Artemisia vulgaris L.
(Asteraceae).
Microfractionation of the extracts was carried out on an LC-MS
8030 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) connected to an FC 204
fraction collector (Gilson, Middleton, WI, U.S.A.) adapted for 96-
deep-well plates. Three injections of each extract were carried out: 2×
30 μL (corresponding to 600 μg of extract) using only the PDA
detector for collection of microfractions, and 1× 10 μL with PDA-
ELSD-ESIMS detection without collection. Water with 0.1% FA (A)
and CH3CN with 0.1% FA (B) were used as mobile phases. The
gradient started with an initial 10% B for 2 min, followed by a gradient
to 100% B in 28 min, and aﬁnal hold at 100% B. Fractions of 1.5 min
each were collected from min 2 to min 38, resulting in 24 fractions.
The microfractions of the two successive runs were collected into the
same well of a 96-deep-well plate. The plate was dried in a Genevac
EZ-2 evaporator. The HPLC-ELSD or HPLC-UV chromatogram was
combined with the activity of fractions to generate the so-called
activity proﬁle.
UHPLC-MS/MS Data Analysis Pipeline. After conversion to
the.mzML format with ThermoRawFileParser61 to also encode the
CAD signal, a custom version of MZmine ( https://github.com/
robinschmid/mzmine2/releases ) was used to perform the Ion
Identity UHPLC-HRMS/MS data processing.29

During the mass detection step, the ions kept were those above a
noise level set at 1.0E5 for MS1 (and 0 for MS2). Chromatogram
builder was employed with a minimum height of 1.0E5 and m/z
tolerance of 0.02 Da. The chromatogram deconvolution was
performed using the wavelets ADAP algorithm62 with a single noise
(S/N) threshold of 3.3, the wavelet scales from 0.00 to 0.10 min, and
a peak duration range from 0.02 to 3.00 min; the MS2 scan pairing
was set at m/z 0.02 Da (0.2 min). The chromatograms were
deisotoped using the isotope peak grouper with anm/z tolerance of
10 ppm, a retention time (RT) tolerance of 0.1 min, and a maximum
charge of 3, while the representative isotope used was the most
intense. Peak alignment was applied using the join aligner method
with an m/z tolerance of 10 ppm, an RT absolute tolerance at 0.1
min, and weight form/z and RT of 1. The peak list was gap-ﬁlled
using the multithreaded peak ﬁnder module with a peak shape
tolerance of 100%, an m/z tolerance of 10 ppm, and 0.1 min.
Duplicated features were removed. Manual curation was performed
on the peak list. Additionally, features wereﬁltered between 0.5 and
77.5 min and with a peak duration range between 0.02 and 3.00 min.
Feature IDs were reset. An ion identity module was used with 10 ppm
tolerance, a minimum height of 1E5, and a minimum cluster size of 2.
Networks without major monomers were discarded. Multiple steps of
adducts and modiﬁcations annotations were performed, including
custom lists. Finally, ion identities were checked by MS/MS, with an
MS2 tolerance of 10 ppm and a minimal MS2 height of 50. Multimers
and neutral losses were checked. Once done, a custom script was built
to remove the gap-ﬁlled area and reintegrate the features using the
gap-ﬁlling module again with a peak shape tolerance of 0%, anm/z
tolerance of 10 ppm, and 0.1 min. Data were exported using both
GNPS and SIRIUS export modules, allowing to merge MS/MS
spectra across samples by a weighted average, summing their
intensities, with an expected mass deviation of 10 ppm, a cosine
threshold of 65%, a peak count threshold of 20%, no isolation window
oﬀset, and an isolation window width of 3 Da. To keep the retention
time, the exact mass information and to allow for the separation of
isomers, an ion identity molecular network was created using the
export resulting from the MZmine pretreatment step detailed above.
A network was then created on GNPS9 where edges wereﬁltered to
have a cosine score above 0.6 and more than six matched peaks.
Further edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and
only if each of the nodes appeared in the respective top 20 most
similar nodes of one anohter. The spectra in the network were then
searched against the GNPS spectral libraries. The precursor ion mass
tolerance was set to 0.02 Da and the MS/MS fragment ion tolerance
to 0.02 Da. A MN was then created where edges wereﬁltered to have
a cosine score above 0.6 and more than 6 matched peaks. Further,
edges between two nodes were kept in the network only if each of the
nodes appeared in each other’s respective top 20 most similar nodes.
Finally, the maximum size of a molecular family was set to 0, and the
lowest-scoring edges were removed from molecular families until the
molecular family size was below this threshold. The spectra in the
network were then searched against the GNPS spectral libraries.9,63
All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were
required to have a score above 0.6 and at least six matched peaks.
Additional edges coming from IIN processing were added. The GNPS
job parameters and resulting data are available at the following
address ( https://gnps.ucsd.edu/Prot eoSAFe/status.jsp?task=

uploaded and accessible on the GNPS servers as Massive Data setsN°
MSV000088606 ( https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.

All spectra were searched against a custom version of the ISDB-
LOTUS database,30,31,64 completed with the Dictionary of Natural
Products (DNP v30.1) using spectral_lib_matcher (https://github.
com/mandelbrot-project/spectral_lib_matcher). All candidates with
less than 0.02 Da deviation from expected mass were kept.
Annotations were then completed and reweighted using an updated
version (https://github.com/taxonomicallyinformedannotation/tima-
r) of the published taxonomically informed scoring16 and the same
custom LOTUS-DNP library. MS1 annotation complementation was
performed with 10 ppm tolerance and 0.05 min for adducts. Allowed
adducts were: [M+3H] 3+,[ M + 2 H + N a ]3+,[ M + H + 2 N a ]3+,[ M

and weighted candidates to 3. Spectral weight was set to 0.333,
chemical weight to 0.167, and biological weight to 0.500. Chemical
and biological scores were attributed to rank/n(ranks), respectively.
The features bioactivity score was calculated as the mean of the
NPIs of the fractions attributed to the feature, multiplied by the
feature abundance in the given fractions.

Extraction and Isolation,Hyptis brevipes. Ground aerial parts
of H. brevipes (350 g) were macerated (5× 5 L EtOAc). The extract
was dried under reduced pressure and freeze-dried to aﬀord 10.9 g of
dry residue. The extract was fractionated byﬂash chromatography on
silica gel (7 × 40cm i.d.) utilizing a gradient of EtOAc inn-hexane
[0−20% (0−20 min), 20−40% (20−75 min), 40−100% (75−300

MeOH for 30 min;ﬂow rate 30 mL/min; sample introduction via dry
load (10.2 g extract absorbed on 40 g silica gel 65 −200 μm)].
Fractions (22 mL) were collected and pooled based on their TLC
(100% EtOAc) patterns to 17 main fractions F1−F17: F1 (waste, 70.3
mg), F2 (1−60; 1.1 g), F3 (61−104; 814.8 mg), F4 (105−139; 951.5
mg); F5 (140−169; 324. 6 mg), F6 (170−196; 246.3 mg), F7 (197−

(321−339; 86.5 mg), F16 (340−369; 101.4 mg), F17 (370−410 +
wash; 4.2 g).
Fractions F10, F11 and F15 were submitted to preparative RP-
HPLC with a gradient of 10−100% CH3CN (solvents containing
0.1% FA) over 30 min. Several injections of F10 (125 mg) aﬀorded 7
(12.4 mg, tR 15.9 min), F11 (238 mg) aﬀorded subfraction P3 (39.3
mg, tR 18.3 min), and F15 (86 mg) aﬀorded subfraction B2 (22.3 mg,
tR 15.4 min). P3 was further separated by semipreparative RP-HPLC
using 40% CH3CN (tR 9.6 min). Further separation with 52% MeOH
(both solvents containing 0.1% FA) provided 1 (16.6 mg, tR 27.4
min) and 2 (3.2 mg, tR 23.5 min). B2 was submitted to
semipreparative HPLC with a gradient 40 −70% MeOH over 30
min to aﬀord fraction C2 (13.3 mg,tR 13.5 min). Compounds4 (1.7
mg, tR 18.0 min) and5 (12.1 mg, tR 16.3 min) were isolated by RP-
HPLC of C2 with 29% CH3CN (solvents containing 0.1% FA). F17

20−70% CH3CN (both containing 0.1% FA) over 45 min, to aﬀord
fraction T2 (18.4 mg, tR 13.7 min). T2 was submitted to
semipreparative HPLC with 25% CH3CN (solvents containing 0.1%
FA) to aﬀord 6 (0.8 mg, tR 14.6 min) and3 (11 mg, tR 17.1 min).
Extraction and Isolation,Hyptis brachiata. Ground aerial parts
of H. brachiata (712 g) were percolated with EtOAc (9 L), followed
by MeOH (17 L), at aﬂow rate of 5 mL/min. Evaporation under
reduced pressure aﬀorded 9.4 g of EtOAc and 27.4 g of MeOH
extract. The EtOAc extract (9.3 g) was prepared for dry loading

on a silica column (7× 46 cm, i.d.) with a gradient of EtOAc inn-
hexane [2% (0−10 min), 2−70% (10−450 min), 70−100% (450−
570 min), 100% (570−615 min)], followed by MeOH in EtOAc
[(0−50% (615−735 min), 50−100% (8735−750 min), 100% (750−

collected and combined based on TLC analysis [n-hexane-EtOAc
(7:3 for fractions 1−264, 1:1 for fractions 265−598, 3:7 for fractions
598−688), EtOAc-MeOH (8:2 for fractions 655 −808)] to 28
fractions (F1 −F28). Further separation of F21 (249.7 mg) by
preparative HPLC with a gradient of 5−100% CH3CN in water (both
containing 0.1% FA) in 30 min gave 21 fractions F21−1 to F21−21.
Fraction F21−13 (17.9 mg, tR 19.0 min) was further puriﬁed by
semipreparative HPLC using a gradient of 30−60% CH3CN in water
(both containing 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min to yield8 (8.9 mg, tR
15.9 min).
Extraction and Isolation, Artemisia argyi. Fraction N (900
mg) of anA. argyiwhole plant EtOAc extract from a previous study50
was fractionated byﬂash chromatography on silica gel (3.5× 45 cm
i.d.). Sample was introduced as dry load (900 mg sample adsorbed on
2.7 g silica gel). The column was eluted with a gradient of MeOH in
CHCl3 [1% MeOH (0−40 min), 1−10% (40−120 min), 10−12.5%
(120−135 min), 12.5−20% (135−155 min), 20−100% (155−165

Calculation of ECD Spectra. Conformational analysis was
performed with Schrödinger MacroModel 11.0 (Schrödinger, LLC,
New York) employing the OPLS2005 (optimized potential for liquid
simulations) force ﬁeld in H2O for geometrical optimization in two
steps. In theﬁrst step, a global minimum was searched using 30,000
steps, in the second step, the global minimum was used for a
conformational search (10,000 steps) choosing ten conformers to be
subjected to geometrical optimization and energy calculation applying
DFT at the CAM-B3LYP/Def2SVP level of theory, employing the
SCRF method and the CPMC model for solvation in MeOH with the
Gaussian 09 program package. 66 Excitation energy (denoted by
wavelength in nm), rotator strength (Rstr), dipole velocity (Rvel), and
dipole length (Rlen) were calculated in MeOH by TD-DFT at the
same level of theory. ECD curves were obtained on the basis of
rotator strengths with a half-band of 0.25 eV using SpecDis v1.7.67
High-Content Assay. A high-content assay (HCA) was
performed as previously described. 23 In brief, patient-derived
MM121224 cells25 were transfected to genetically encoding H2B-
mTurquoise, ERK- and AKT-KTRs. For the experiments, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with extracts, fractions, or pure
compounds. Afterward, they were ﬁxed and imaged with a HCS
microscope. A computer vision approach was used to automatically
segment each cell, and extract a ratio of cytosol over nuclear ratio
indicative of ERK or AKT activity. The isolated compounds were
tested at eight diﬀerent concentrations starting at 200μM to 1.56μM
(97 μM to 0.8μM for 8).
