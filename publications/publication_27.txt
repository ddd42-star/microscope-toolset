Growth cones are complex, motile structures at the tip of an outgrowing neurite. They often exhibit a high density 
of filopodia (thin actin bundles), which complicates the unbiased quantification of their morphologies by software. 
Contemporary image processing methods require extensive tuning of segmentation parameters, require significant manual 
curation, and are often not sufficiently adaptable to capture morphology changes associated with switches in regulatory 
signals. T o overcome these limitations, we developed Growth Cone Analyzer (GCA). GCA is designed to quantify growth 
cone morphodynamics from time-lapse sequences imaged both in vitro and in vivo, but is sufficiently generic that it may 
be applied to nonneuronal cellular structures. We demonstrate the adaptability of GCA through the analysis of growth 
cone morphological variation and its relation to motility in both an unperturbed system and in the context of modified Rho 
GTPase signaling. We find that perturbations inducing similar changes in neurite length exhibit underappreciated phenotypic 
nuance at the scale of the growth cone.

Introduction
Already in the mid-eighties, Bray and Chapman (1985) had pos-
tulated that a systematic assessment of morphology would be 
essential for unraveling the principles governing growth cone 
(GC) locomotion and navigation, events fundamental for neuro-
nal development. A surprisingly limited number of efforts have 
picked up this thread. While recent work has tested correlations 
between neurite outgrowth rates and morphological/dynamic GC 
features (Hyland et al., 2014; Steketee et al., 2014; Ren and Suter, 
2016), in these studies, quantification of GC morphology was per-
formed by tedious visual inspection of hand-selected datasets, 
and/or considered only coarse descriptions of shape (Goodhill et 
al., 2015; Suo et al., 2015; Ren and Suter, 2016). Numerous studies 
have analyzed the effect of putative perturbations of GC regu-
lation using endpoint metrics of neurite length observed at low 
resolution (e.g., Briançon-Marjollet et al., 2008; Chandran et al., 
2016), without considering the effects on GC architecture. Such 
limited quantification is likewise pervasive in studies investi -
gating the role of Rho GTPases, key regulators of cytoskeleton 
organization and dynamics (Hall and Lalli, 2010 ) in neuronal 
outgrowth. Hence, a proper validation of Bray’s paradigm that 
GC morphology and motility are coupled is still outstanding.
To enable acquisition of an unbiased inventory of GC morpholo-
gies and their motility output, we developed Growth Cone Analyzer 
(GCA) for fully automated analysis of high-resolution GC fluores-
cent movies. GCA addresses common limitations cited by current 
software for GC analysis (Misiak et al., 2014; Goodhill et al., 2015; 
Jacquemet et al., 2017; Urbančič et al., 2017), including poor detec-
tion of fine, low signal-to-noise structures known as filopodia, as 
well as difficulty in resolving crossed filopodia. Furthermore, while 
available GC analysis software offers generic schemes for the identi-
fication of veil protrusions (Tsygankov et al., 2014; Jacquemet et al., 
2017; Urbančič et al., 2017), GCA includes a detection module specifi-
cally designed for complex, multi-scale, veil/stem morphologies and 
provides measurements of neurite outgrowth.
To showcase GCA, we provide a quantitative analysis of motile 
GCs in the presence/absence of Rho GTPase pathway perturbations 
previously identified to produce shifts in neurite outgrowth in an 
N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma model system (Pertz et al., 2008; 
Fusco et al., 2016). The approach introduced here provides insight 
into how neurite outgrowth relates to processes at the scale of the 
GC and unveils novel layers of cytoskeletal regulation that illus-
trate the complexity of Rho GTPase signaling in neurite outgrowth.

Quantification of heterogeneity among growth cones

1997; Sarner et al., 2000; Pertz et al., 2008; Dent et al., 2011; Özel et 
al., 2015; Fusco et al., 2016), adopt a wide variety of shape config-
urations (Fig. S1 A). This morphological heterogeneity is exacer-
bated by genetic manipulations targeting cytoskeleton regulation 
(Fig. S1 B). GC morphology , while diverse, is ultimately dictated by 
the integration of two stereotypically shaped actin structures: a 
veil-like lamellipodium interspersed with thin filopodia (Lowery 
and Van Vactor, 2009). Filopodia are curvilinear actin bundles, and 
hence can best be identified by common ridge detectors (Frangi et 
al., 1998; Jacob and Unser, 2004; Fig. S1 C, i). In contrast, lamelli-
podial veils can be quite amorphous and therefore require a dif-
ferent image processing method (Fig. S1 C, ii). Furthermore, veils 
are interjected by consolidated, ridge-like segments of the neurite, 
referred to here as the stem (Fig. S1 C, iii and iv). Therefore, the 
terminal end of the growing neurite can be viewed as a unique 
conglomerate of distinct geometric features requiring differential 
image processing for optimal detection of each component. Seg-
mentation tools that rely on a single image processing approach 
such as global thresholding (Costantino et al., 2008; Tsygankov et 
al., 2014) fail on this type of data (Fig. S1 D).
GCA pipeline
To address the challenges of quantifying GC morphology , we de-
veloped GCA (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). GCA reconstructs the veil/stem 
and filopodia/branch system in two parallel detection steps op-
timized for each feature (Fig. 1 A, ii–v). It then recombines the 
information to create a high-fidelity segmentation (Fig. 1 A, vi–x; 
and Fig. S3). Fig. 1 outlines the general workflow of the algorithm 
for a canonical GC (Fig. 1, A and C; and Video 1), and highlights 
intersections where the algorithm automatically deviates from 
this workflow to address segmentation challenges posed by non-
canonical GC morphologies (Fig. 1, B and D; Videos 2 and 3; and 
Fig. S3; see Materials and methods).
Validation of GCA algorithm
Fig. 2 (Videos 4, 5, and 6) shows the GCA segmentation for the 
set of images outlined in Fig. S1 A. Notably , the same filopodia/
branch segmentation parameters (Table S1) were used for the en-
tire N1E-115 GC dataset (n = 72 movies). While visual inspection 
is commonly considered the gold standard for validation of auto-
mated image analysis, given the complexity of GC architectures, 
and indeed most biological images, it is nontrivial to obtain an un-
biased “ground truth” by manual annotation (Kozubek, 2016). For 
example, we have shown previously that manual annotation of 
whole-cell scale N1E-115 images differ, sometimes substantially , 
among annotators (Fusco et al., 2016). In the case of the N1E-115 
GC scale images, we found even documentation of filopodia end-
point coordinates an impossible task for a group of manual an-
notators to perform systematically; ultimately , GCA provided a 
more standardized definition of filopodia length (Fig. 2, B–D; see 
Materials and methods). Given the above challenges, we devised 
a semi-automated approach to quantify the accuracy of the filo-
podia/actin bundle lengths (Fig. 2 E, Fig. S4, and Fig. S5 D) and 
detection numbers (Fig. 2 F and Fig. S5, A–C) extracted by GCA 
(see Materials and methods).
We found GCA to perform well, notably with minimal seg-
mentation parameter changes, on GC images of different sizes, 
types, and fluorescent labels, imaged both in vitro and in vivo/
ex vivo (Fig. 3, Fig. S6, and Videos 7 and 8), and GCA generalized 
well to non-GC images with filopodia (Fig. 3, E–G). These results 
underlie the robustness of the pipeline and indicate that while 
some heuristics were necessary to design the algorithm, the 
pipeline can be applied to vastly diverse imaging datasets with 
little user input.
We also confirmed that contemporary software with similar 
goals to GCA (Jacquemet et al., 2017; Urbančič et al., 2017) is in-
sufficient for the assessment of Rho GTPase perturbation of N1E-
115 GCs and some in vivo morphologies (Fig. 4, A–C), even after 
extensive attempts to optimize control parameters. In contrast, 
GCA was able to segment test images included in these pack-
ages, with only minimal and intuitive segmentation parameter 
adjustments, and offered a number of substantial advances not 
available with the previous methods (Fig.  4, D–G; see Materi-
als and methods).
Extraction of morphodynamic features
Segmentation via GCA enables quantification of many GC mor-
phodynamic features (Fig. 5). These features include “global/
functional” measurements, such as neurite length/outgrowth 
rate (Fig. 5 A), as well as more spatially localized measurements 
such as veil/stem thickness and dynamics (Fig. 5 B), the filopo-
dia geometry and its integration with the veil (Fig. 5 C), and the 
branching pattern (Fig. 5 D; see Materials and methods). No-
tably , GCA extraction of filopodia lengths/densities (Mogilner 
and Rubinstein, 2005) and comparative analyses of local veil 
velocities (Sivadasan et al., 2016; Fig. S6 and Video  8) were 
consistent with manual quantification previously reported. 
Hence, GCA provides a robust framework for multi-variate fea-
ture extraction.
Relationship between neurite outgrowth and GC 
scale morphodynamics
Equipped with this analytical pipeline, we returned to this ques-
tion: Does GC motility relate to GC morphology? While molecu-
lar perturbations can indeed induce changes in GC morphology 
(Pertz et al., 2008; Fig. S1 B), they are also often accompanied by 
larger system adaptations that complicate interpretation of mo-
tility phenotypes. Therefore, we first sought to use the full distri-
bution of GCA features to detect potential morphology–motility 
relations latent within the heterogeneous control population. We 
analyzed 20 movies (10-min) of unperturbed N1E-115 GCs and 
identified correlations between neurite-to-neurite variation in 
net outgrowth rate (Fig. 6 A) and temporally averaged GC mor-
phology features (Fig. 6 B).
Testing for monotonic relationships between feature pairs 
(Fig. 6 C) revealed a positive correlation between filopodia length 
and curvature, and a negative correlation between filopodia 
length and veil protrusion persistence. However, we were par-
ticularly interested in identifying correlations between neurite 
outgrowth rate and GC morphology (Fig. 6, C and D). The stron-
gest correlations included an inverse relationship between neu-
rite outgrowth and filopodia actin bundle/branch length, as well 
as a positive relationship between outgrowth and the percentage 
each filopodium was embedded by veil (Fig. 6, C and D). Other

actin bundle features, such as filopodia density , orientation, and 
branch complexity , were not significantly correlated to net neu-
rite outgrowth in 10 min. Likewise, the veil stem thickness was 
a poor predictor, in line with Hyland et al. (2014). Visualization 
of select movies corresponding to key data points in the neurite 
outgrowth rate distribution (Fig.  6 A), namely the population 
extremes (Fig. 6 E, i and iv), and two movies within ±SD of the 
mean (Fig. 6 E, ii and iii) confirmed the structures of these GCs 
were consistent with the conclusions drawn from the correlation 
analysis (Fig. 6 E and Video 4).
GC scale morphodynamic phenotypes upon perturbation of 
Rho GTPase signaling
We next sought to test if the additional morphological variation 
introduced by siRNA-mediated perturbations of Rho GTPase sig-
naling would support the correlative relations. We focused upon 
a subset of knockdowns (KDs) found to induce neurite length 
defects within an ∼ 20-h timescale (Fusco et al., 2016; Table 
S2). These included Rac1 and three structurally distinct, posi-
tive regulators of Rac1 activity , β-Pix (also known as ARH GEF7; 
ten Klooster et al., 2006 ), Dock7 (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2006 ,

and Trio (Debant et al., 1996; Briançon-Marjollet et al., 2008). 
In addition, we examined perturbations resulting in enhanced 
neurite length (Fusco et al., 2016). This set included siRNA KD of 
(1) a negative regulator of Rac1 ( srGAP2; Guerrier et al., 2009); 
(2) RhoA, whose downstream signaling via its effector ROCK has 
been implicated in neurite retraction in response to inhibitory 
stimuli (Kozma et al., 1997; Amano et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2003); 
and (3) Cdc42, which, when reduced, is typically associated with 
shorter neurite lengths (Chandran et al., 2016), but exhibits ro-
bust up-regulation of neurite outgrowth in our system, similar 
to that observed upon RhoA depletion (Pertz et al., 2008; Fusco 
et al., 2016; Fig. 2 A and Videos 5 and 6).
GC feature values were averaged per GC movie, and a z-score 
between control and perturbation calculated (Fig. 7 A, left). This 
z-score vector across all features defined a GC scale morpho-
dynamic signature (MS) for each KD, similar to the whole-cell 
scale profiles extracted previously in this same system (Fusco et 
al., 2016). Notably , hierarchical clustering of the GC scale MSs 
generally grouped the perturbations according to their previ-
ously characterized whole-cell scale MSs (Fig. 7 A) and provided

further insight as to how these neurite length phenotypes may 
arise. For instance, Rac1, Dock7, and Trio KD all showed reduced 
whole-cell scale neurite outgrowth dynamics, and in all cases, the 
corresponding GC scale MS was characterized by long filopodia/
branches, low actin bundle veil embedment, and reduced veil dy-
namics (Videos 5 and 6). Analogous GC features were character-
istic of stagnant neurites in the unperturbed population (Fig. 6, 
B–D). In contrast, β-Pix KD neurites were more dynamic at the

whole-cell scale, despite their final short-neurite phenotype. Ac-
cordingly , GCs were characterized by a similar yet milder filopo-
dia and veil dynamics phenotype (Fig. 7 A and Video 6)
Conversely , srGAP2 KD GCs, which likely display enhanced 
Rac1 activity (Guerrier et al., 2009), and exhibit elevated neurite 
elongation/branching (Pertz et al., 2008; Fusco et al., 2016) at 
the whole-cell scale, showed increased local veil protrusion ve-
locities without major changes in filopodia morphology (Fig. 7 A 
and Video 6). The srGAP2 KD profile was also distinct from the 
other neurite length–enhancing perturbations tested. RhoA and 
Cdc42 KD GCs, while displaying enhanced neurite outgrowth at 
the whole-cell scale, failed to induce significant changes in the 
local veil velocity . Furthermore, Cdc42 KD resulted in a strong en-
hancement in filopodia length, while RhoA KD resulted in reduc-
tion of the veil/stem thickness (Fig. 7 A). Clustering the data by 
neurite outgrowth rate confirmed that robustly elongating Cdc42 
KDs indeed exhibit longer actin bundles (Fig. 7 C, i), a feature typ-
ically associated with low outgrowth in the unperturbed popula-
tion (Fig. 6 D, v). In contrast, with the exception of Dock7 KD, the 
initially striking actin bundle/filopodia length phenotypes ex -
hibited by Rac1 and the Rac1 GEF KDs (Fig. 7 A) were diminished 
when normalizing for the effect of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7 C, 
ii). These results indicate that GCs exhibiting features usually re-
lated to inefficient neurite outgrowth can display robust neurite 
elongation under certain signaling conditions, highlighting the 
complexity of the mechanisms coupling Rho GTPase activity , GC 
morphology , and the up-regulation of neurite outgrowth.
The sensitivity of GCA facilitated the interpretation of the 
visually striking kinked and buckling filopodia observed upon 
Dock7 or Trio KD (Fig. S1 B, Fig. 2 A, and Fig. 5 C). While, indeed, 
the curvature of filopodia in these perturbations was increased, 
further assessment of the length and curvature variation in the 
unperturbed GCs also indicated a strong correlation among these 
two measurements, both among the averaged neurite movie 
values (Fig.  6  C) and at the level of the individual filopodium 
(Fig. 7 D). Indeed, normalization for the effect of filopodia length 
on curvature ( Fig. 7 E ) suggests that the increases in filopodia 
curvature upon these perturbations is primarily associated with 
increased filopodia length. These results, combined with those 
highlighted in Fig. 7 (B and C), demonstrate that the extraction 
of multiple features is necessary for the biological interpretation 
of these GC phenotypes.
Identification of morphological transitions along a neurite 
outgrowth trajectory
Time-averaged analysis of unperturbed (Fig. 6) and Rac1 path-
way perturbation data (Fig. 7) revealed consistent relationships 
between morphology and net neurite outgrowth on a 10-min 
timescale. However, the averaging may mask more nuanced 
relationships. We therefore sought an analytical framework to 
(1) confirm morphology/motility relationships at the level of 
individual neurite trajectories and (2) visualize potential sub-
populations of GCs where these relationships may be altered. As 
fluctuations among morphological features may be nontrivially 
coupled, transitions between morphological states in a time-
lapse sequence can likely be most robustly identified by combin-
ing multiple GCA features. Hence we asked if Hidden Markov/
Bayesian model (HMM) selection of multi-variate GC feature 
trajectories could be employed to identify the timing of GC mor-
phology changes, as recently proposed by Gordonov et al. (2016) 
for the detection of coarse-grain morphology transitions in mi-
grating breast cancer cells.
To validate the HMM, we used the small molecule CK666 
(Nolen et al., 2009) to acutely inhibit the actin nucleator Arp2/3. 
This perturbation has been previously shown to induce defects 
in GC morphology ( Yang et al., 2012) and neurite outgrowth 
(Fusco et al., 2016). Consistent with observations in Aplysia 
(Yang et al., 2012), CK666 treatment of N1E-115 GCs induced both 
the enhancement of filopodia length and decreases in the veil-  
embedment of individual actin bundles (Fig. 8, A and B). Further-
more, in line with predictions from our unperturbed correlation 
data (Fig. 6), neurites treated with CK666 consistently induced 
increases in the percent time the neurite spent paused or retract-
ing (Fig. 8 C).
Seven morphological GCA features ( Fig. 5) were selected to 
generate a per-frame feature vector (Fig. 8 D, i) for each GC movie 
in the full N1E-115 dataset (n = 72). For visualization, these data 
were reduced to two dimensions via multi-dimensional scaling 
(MDS; see Materials and methods). We also used MDS coordi-
nates to estimate the relative likelihood of a GC to maintain a 
particular combination of morphology features (Fig. 8 D, ii). Vi-
sualization of the pretreatment frames (Fig. 8 D , iii) indicated 
neurite-to-neurite heterogeneity in the GC shape before DMSO/
drug application (Fig. 8 D, iv). However, upon CK666 treatment, 
GC trajectories diverged in morphology space (Fig.  8  E), and 
these morphological transitions appeared correlated with the 
switch from neurite elongation to pausing/retraction (Fig. 8, C 
[ii] and E [i]).
To identify potential morphology state transitions along each 
trajectory , HMM with Bayesian model selection ( Posada and 
Buckley , 2004) was applied to the MDS coordinates for DMSO- 
and CK666-treated trajectories (Fig. 9 A). To confirm the repro-
ducibility of the detected state transitions, we analyzed the HMM 
state transitions for all six movies within a 90-s window after 
application of treatment. CK666 treatment consistently resulted 
in morphology state transitions of similar direction, magni-
tude, and timing (Fig. 9, A [ii] and B; and Video 10). In contrast, 
after DMSO treatment, morphology transitions were either not 
observed (Fig. 9 B) or pointed in the opposing direction of the 
CK666-induced transitions (Fig. 9 A, i; and Video 9). Comparison 
of the feature value distributions corresponding to each of the 
HMM morphology states identified along the DMSO- (Fig. 9 C, 
i) and CK666-treated (Fig. 9 C, ii) GC movie trajectories revealed 
differences in the individual feature fluctuations, distinguishing 
the two transitions. This validates the HMM-based approach as 
an analytical method to isolate significant transitions in GC mor-
phology in an unperturbed system or when the timing/effect of a 
system perturbation is not known a priori.
We then used the MDS plots to visualize the dependence of 
neurite outgrowth on the morphological feature set. We exam-
ined the relative positioning of the two unperturbed GC movies 
exhibiting the highest and lowest net outgrowth (Fig. 6, A and 
E). This revealed a rough gradient, whereby higher MDS1 values 
correlated with poor neurite outgrowth within the unperturbed

population (Fig. 9 D, i and iii). In addition, the direction of the 
CK666-induced transitions in GC morphology (blue arrows in 
Fig. 9, A [ii], B, and D [iii]) corresponded well with the direction 
of this outgrowth state gradient.
Based on these observations, we screened all unperturbed 
GC trajectories (Fig. 6) for morphological transitions. HMM au-
tomatically identified the timing of a spontaneous morphology 
transition in the unperturbed population (Fig. 9 D, ii), which was 
coupled to a switch between neurite elongation and retraction 
(Fig. 9 D, iii). Evaluation of the feature profiles of the HMM states 
along this trajectory (Fig. 9, E and F) confirmed that the transi-
tion was characterized by a significant enhancement of filopodia 
lengths, similar to the transition observed with CK666 treatment 
(Fig. 9 C, ii). These data show that similar relationships between 
GC morphology and motility are maintained in the larger popu-
lation of unperturbed GCs for at least a subset of the trajectories.
Rho GTPase pathway perturbed GCs in the context of the 
morphology landscape
Visualization of the siRNA perturbations within the reduced 
morphology space (Fig. 10, A–G) reinforced the morphology/mo-
tility patterns found in the unperturbed population ( Fig. 9 D ). 
For example, Rac1, Dock7, and Trio KD, perturbations which at 
whole-cell scale produce the most profound dampening of neu-
rite outgrowth (Fusco et al., 2016), maintained high MDS1 val-
ues (Fig. 10, E–G). In contrast, a majority of the β-Pix KD movies 
(Fig.  10  C), as well as outgrowth-enhancing perturbations, 
showed more overlap with the control (Fig. 10, A, B, D, and H). 
Finally , the acute inhibition of ARP2/3 activity via CK666 con-
sistently shifted GC morphologies toward the state of GCs likely 
to have reduced Rac1 activity (Fig. 10, C, and E–G), though the 
endpoint of a CK666-induced transition depended upon the GC 
state at the time of drug application. In summary , these results 
demonstrate that features extracted from the GCA software can 
be combined with time series modeling (Gordonov et al., 2016) 
to identify the timing of significant transitions in GC shape and 
to study the relationship of such morphological transitions with 
the neurite’s outgrowth behavior.
Discussion
T echnological advances for the automated analysis 
of GC morphology
Unbiased quantification of the relations between GC structure 
and neurite outgrowth is crucial for understanding GC function. 
While several toolkits for GC analysis (Costantino et al., 2008; 
Misiak et al., 2014; Goodhill et al., 2015; Jacquemet et al., 2017; 
Urbančič et al., 2017) or generic filopodia detection (Nilufar et al., 
2013; Tsygankov et al., 2014; Barry et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2016) 
have been developed, they maintain too many technical limita-
tions to allow the study of morphology/motility relationships 
in diverse cellular datasets (Fig. 4, A–C). We developed GCA to 
remove the vast majority of these technological barriers (Fig. 1  
and Fig. 4). GCA provides a versatile segmentation framework 
by introducing (1) multi-scale ridge filter analysis to detect stem 
and filopodia; (2) filopodia-endpoint detection based on an adap-
tive, self-configuring model of the fluorescence decay along these 
structures; and (3) assembly by graph-matching of detected 
filopodia fragments into a complete representation of filopodia 
networks containing branches and apparent crossings present 
in 2D. Combined, these algorithms generate a segmentation and 
parameterization of GC morphology that is robust across a wide 
spectrum of GC types (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Hence, we were able to 
capture the natural as well as experimentally induced variation 
in GC structure and apply various post-processing tools to model 
putative relations between GC morphology and motility .
Mining heterogeneity of unperturbed GCs
The robust quantification afforded by GCA allowed us to mine 
latent information in neurite-to-neurite heterogeneity observed 
within an unperturbed population of N1E-115 GCs (Fig.  6). In 
doing so, we found that net neurite outgrowth within a 10-min 
window is most strongly correlated with GC structures charac-
terized by filopodia length and branching, as well as increased 
actin bundle veil-embedment (Fig. 6 D). The dominant relation-
ships between GC morphology and outgrowth discovered in our 
system corroborate two classical, more qualitative studies that 
tested correlations between neurite outgrowth rate and subjec-
tively defined GC morphological classifications (Kleitman and 
Johnson, 1989; Mason and Wang, 1997). However, if and how 
these morphology/motility relationships are dependent on GC 
subtype and extracellular environment remains an open ques-
tion. The adaptability of GCA (Fig. 3, A–D; Fig. S6; and Videos 7 
and 8) should enable rapid and unbiased screening of such rela-
tionships in other GC systems.
Perturbation of Rac1 signaling corroborates GC morphology/
motility relations discovered in the unperturbed population
Multi-scale, morphodynamic quantification of perturbations 
converging on the Rac1 pathway (Fig.  2  A, Fig.  7, and Fig.  8) 
further confirm the relationship between GC morphology and 
motility unveiled by the unperturbed population (Fig. 6, Fig. 8, 
Fig. 9 D, and Fig. 10). Specifically, KD of Rac1, or two Rac1 guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; Trio and Dock7), reduced 
neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7 A; Fusco et al., 2016) and induced GCs 
with veils of diminished dynamics and long, curved filopodia 
(Fig. 7 A and Videos 5 and 6). These changes are consistent with 
Rac1’s well-established role as an activator of branched actin net-
work expansion (Miki et al., 1998; Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007; 
Tahirovic et al., 2010). Importantly , the filopodial morphology of

these KDs (Fig. 2 and Fig. 7) is reminiscent of those poorly elon-
gating neurites observed at the morphological boundaries of the 
unperturbed population (Fig. 6, A and E; and Fig. 9 D, iii), though 
in the case of Dock7 KD, these features were often exaggerated 
(Fig. 10, F and G).
Interestingly , the GCs of the β-Pix KD displayed a less con-
spicuous phenotype. β-Pix KD induced decreases in the veil-
stem thickness and veil protrusion persistence time, while veil 
protrusion velocities and filopodia actin bundle length were un-
affected (Fig. 7 A). A majority of β-Pix KD GCs shared features 
with pausing GCs in the unperturbed population (Video 6). This 
more subtle GC phenotype observed for β-Pix GCs is consistent 
with previous whole-cell scale results (Fusco et al., 2016), which 
found that unlike Rac1, Dock7, and Trio KD, β-Pix KD did not 
disrupt the frequency of neurite elongation events, but still in-
duced an overall neurite length deficit. Given our combined GC/
whole-cell scale results, we speculate that β-Pix maintains the 
spatial veil coordination necessary for sustained neurite elon-
gation, while Dock7/Trio potentially facilitates the initiation of 
veil protrusions.
Conversely, KD of srGAP2, a Rac1-specific GTPase activating 
protein (GAP; Guerrier et al., 2009), led to increased neurite out-
growth and branching at the whole-cell scale (Fusco et al., 2016), 
and a pronounced increase in GC veil dynamics without any pro-
found effect on GC morphology (Fig. 7 A), phenocopying unper-
turbed GCs that exhibit robust outgrowth rates (Fig. 9 D, iii; and 
Fig. 10, B and H). The opposing veil phenotypes of srGAP2 ver-
sus Rac1, Trio, or Dock7 KD suggest increased versus decreased 
Rac1 activity at the veil (Fig. 7 A), inducing specific morphologies 
that reside at opposing ends of the GC morphological landscape 
(Fig. 10). This spectrum of phenotypes associated with Rac1 path-
way perturbations forms a similar gradient in both morphology 
and neurite outgrowth to that observed with acute perturbation of 
ARP2/3 (Fig. 10, B, C, and E–G). The agreement between GC phe-
notypes associated with diminished Rac1 activity and those associ-
ated with direct perturbation of Arp2/3 supports Arp2/3’s role as a 
WA VE complex effector (Takenawa and Miki, 2001; Takenawa and 
Suetsugu, 2007; Tahirovic et al., 2010), localized to the GC periph-
eral domain for the purpose of controlling veil protrusion (Mongiu 
et al., 2007; Tahirovic et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). Interestingly , 
HMM analysis of the multi-variate GC morphology trajectories 
of the unperturbed population revealed spontaneous, albeit rare, 
morphological transitions (Fig. 9, D [ii], E, and F) along the gradi-
ent of Rac1 activation (Fig. 10, B, C, and E–G) that resembled the 
transitions induced by acute Arp2/3 inhibition (Fig. 9 D, iii). Com-
bined, these results (1) suggest that fluctuations in Rac1 signaling 
may occur under these experimental conditions, generating some 
of the natural variation in morphology and neurite outgrowth of 
the unperturbed population; and (2) highlight the complexity of 
Rac1 regulation by multiple GEFs/GAPs.
Changes in morphology/motility relations upon perturbation 
of Cdc42/RhoA signaling
Quantification at the GC scale revealed under-appreciated phe-
notypic nuances among the three selected perturbations en-
hancing neurite outgrowth (Cdc42, RhoA, and srGAP2). While 
srGAP2 KD predominately modified veil velocity, not morphol-
ogy , on the GC scale, Cdc42 and RhoA KD induced distinct effects 
on GC morphology without changes in veil velocity (Fig. 7 A). GCs 
of RhoA KD cells showed markedly reduced veil/stems (Fig. 7 A) 
and sometimes shared composite feature profiles with the poorly 
elongating Trio KDs (Fig. 10, D and F), an intriguing finding as 
Trio is known to activate both RhoA and Rac1 (Debant et al., 1996). 
Cdc42 KD, in stark contradiction to the classic view of Cdc42 as 
a positive regulator of both neurite outgrowth (Chandran et al., 
2016) and filopodia formation (Nobes and Hall, 1995), induced 
robustly elongating neurites (Fusco et al., 2016; Fig. 7 A) with 
corresponding GC morphologies characterized by enhanced 
filopodia lengths and decreased actin bundle veil-embedment 
(Fig. 7 C, i)—features correlated with poor neurite outgrowth in 
the unperturbed population (Fig. 6 D). Importantly , no decrease 
in the GC veil/stem thickness was observed for the Cdc42 KDs 
(Fig.  7, A and C, i), indicating the enhanced filopodia lengths 
were not simply a consequence of defects in the veil. While our 
observations are consistent with more recent studies suggesting 
that Cdc42 knockout fibroblasts retain filopodia (Czuchra et al., 
2005), to our knowledge this is the first time an increase in filo-
podia length has been associated with a Cdc42 KD.
In our system, Cdc42 and RhoA KDs appear to induce long 
neurites due to suppression of GC collapse events (Fusco et al., 
2016). This would imply a dual role for Cdc42/RhoA signaling—
one regulating GC scale architecture, the other switching be-
tween neurite outgrowth/retraction states. Alternatively , altered 
relationships between morphology and neurite outgrowth may 
flag larger changes in the mechanism by which outgrowth occurs 
under these system perturbations. For instance, unlike in unper-
turbed GCs, the long filopodia associated with the Cdc42 KD may 
facilitate elongation in the context of the perturbed signaling. 
To better understand these more complex relations between 
signaling and morphology , Rho GTPase activity must be imaged 
directly within veil and individual filopodia. A combination of 
GCA segmentation, Förster resonance energy transfer biosensor 
technology (Fritz et al., 2013), and filopodia tracking will be the 
key to distinguishing the corresponding signaling of long filopo-
dia associated with different outgrowth states.
The future of GC analysis
GCA provides the technical foundation for a wide array of future 
GC studies. The enhanced filopodia detections, combined with the 
extracted veil protrusion vectors (Machacek and Danuser, 2006; 
Ma et al., 2018), may be incorporated into previously developed 
morphology features (72 GC movies: 8,454 frames). Probability density isocontours for entire dataset visualized in 3D (top) and 2D (bottom). (iii) Example of

tracking frameworks (Jaqaman et al., 2008) for the extraction of 
filopodia dynamics metrics from elongating/retracting GCs. Fur-
thermore, GCA will expedite the extraction of high-confidence 
fluorescent signals with respect to a variety of GC morphological 
fiduciaries, including the tip/base of the filopodia, the veil edge, 
or the site of the GCs leading protrusion. HMM of multi-variate 
morphological GC features, as tested in Fig. 9, may prove useful 
for the identification of other, more subtle, correlations between 
GC morphology and neurite outgrowth, the quantification of the 
kinetics associated with specific morphology-state switches, and 
deconvolution of heterogeneous drug responses.
In summary , it is clear that the future challenge will be ef-
ficiently integrating information gleaned from the combinator-
ically expansive number of cell intrinsic/extrinsic scenarios to 
pinpoint physiologically relevant mechanistic commonalities 
and divergences governing neurite outgrowth and guidance. Au-
tomated GC analysis in vitro and in vivo allows for rapid, compre-
hensive cataloging of GC features, and thus will be fundamental 
for the synthesis of image data corresponding to different GC 
systems from independent laboratories.

Materials and methods
Cell culture and transfection
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (American Tissue Culture Collec-
tion) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% 
l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For differentia -
tion, N1E-115 cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free Neuro -
basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% l -glutamine 
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Both siRNA and LifeAct GFP re-
porter were transfected simultaneously as previously described 
(Chong et al., 2006). Specifically , 400 ng of the plasmid pLen-
ti-LifeAct-GFP , 20 pmol of the specific siRNA (Invitrogen Stealth 
Select), and 1 µl of TransFectin (Bio-Rad) were used in one trans-
fection reaction. 48  h after transfection, cells were starved in 
Neurobasal medium. 72 h after transfection, cells were detached 
with Puck’s saline and replated on a glass-bottom 24-multiwell 
plate (MatTek), coated with 10 µg/ml laminin overnight at 4°C 
(Millipore). 24 h after plating, cells were imaged in Neurobasal 
medium (Invitrogen) in a heated closed chamber. Plasmid trans-
fection rates were measured at ∼70%. 90% KD efficiency for select 
siRNAs used in this study was previously confirmed by Western 
blot or quantitative PCR as shown previously (Fusco et al., 2016). 
LifeAct GFP–transfected cells were therefore assumed to be also 
siRNA-transfected. Based on our previous siRNA screen on N1E-
115 whole-cell scale neurite outgrowth (Fusco et al., 2016), we use 
specific siRNA sequences to knock down with the lowest possible 
amount of off-target effect (Table S2). Specifically , we used the 
siRNA that yielded the most similar whole-cell scale MS to the 
average MS of three distinct siRNAs.

Image acquisition of N1E-115 morphodynamics
All experiments were performed on an inverted Eclipse Ti micro-
scope (Nikon) equipped with a motorized stage, hardware-based 
autofocus, and CoolLED light source, and controlled using Meta-
morph imaging software (Universal Imaging) using a PlanApo 
60×/NA 1.4 objective. The images were acquired every 5 s for a 
total of 10 min. A Coolsnap HQ2 camera (Photometrics) was used 
for image acquisition. In the CK666 experiments, the cells were 
first imaged for 5 min without drug, and then for an additional  
5 min with DMSO, or DMSO plus CK666 (corresponding to a final 
concentration of 25 µM CK666).
GCA: Overview
The GCA pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 1, and the full algorithmic 
scheme is outlined in Fig. S2.
Veil/Stem reconstruction
To detect the veil/stem of the neurite (Fig.  1  A, iii–v; and Fig. 
S2, Steps I–III) the algorithm combines a broadband ridge filter 
(Jacob and Unser, 2004; Fig. S2, Steps I and II) with an initial 
intensity-based thresholding (Niblack, 1985)/morphological 
opening (Maitre, 2008; Fig. S2, Step III). While the former de-
tects the thick, ridge-like, consolidated regions of the neurite 
stem and its entrance into the image (Fig. 1 A, iii), the second 
step facilitates detection of more amorphous actin veils, which 
fail to conform to a ridge detector (Fig. 1 A, iv). When the stem is 
relatively thick, and of high signal to background (e.g., Fig. 1 A, 
iii–v), the ridge information mainly serves to identify the neu-
rite entrance point in the image (Fig. 1 A, iii, black star). How-
ever, images of GCs positioned within more complicated local 
environments (Fig. 1 B, i) and/or exhibiting more complex veil/
stem morphologies (Fig. 1 B , ii and iii) require the integration 
of the ridge information for successful segmentation (Fig. S2, 
Steps I–III; and Video 2).
Filopodia/Branch network reconstruction
A similar ridge localization scheme as employed for stem de-
tection (Jacob and Unser, 2004) is used to detect filopodia with 
high sensitivity (Fig. 1 A, ii). However, this detection scheme has 
two limitations: (1) since the width of filopodia approaches the 
diffraction limit of the microscope (∼200 nm), high frequency 
noise is often also detected; and (2) regions where filopodia cross, 
branch, or connect to the veil give low signal, introducing breaks 
in the GC segmentation.
We solve both problems by first combining the veil/stem with 
the thin ridge information to create a “high confidence seed” 
(Fig. 1 A, vii), i.e., only filopodia segments attached to, and residing 
outside of, the veil/stem are maintained. These seed pixels serve 
as an anchor for (1) iterative reattachment of filopodia segments 
that may have been disconnected due to weak ridge detector re-
sponses at junctions (Fig. 1 A, viii, Veil), (2) resolution of crossing 
filopodia (Fig. 1 D and Video 3), (3) grouping thin filopodia/actin 
branched structures (Fig. 1, A [viii, Branch] and D; and Video 3), 
and (4) detection of actin bundles embedded in the veil (Fig. 1 C). 
Final segmentation is obtained via three different, but analogously 
formulated, graph matching steps: (1) a filopodia segment–build-
ing step that associates curvilinear segments of detected filopodia 
broken due to filopodia crossing/branching (Fig. 1 A, vi), (2) an it-
erative filopodia/branch network reconstruction step to reattach 
filopodia/branch candidates to seed pixels (Fig. 1 A, vii; and Fig. 
S3), and (3) an optional step to associate embedded actin bundle 
detections with their corresponding filopodia (Fig. 1 C).
Filopodia endpoint localization
To enhance the filopodia tip localization accuracy , we modified 
the intensity fitting approach used previously to localize micro-
tubule tips (Demchouk et al., 2011). In this approach, the tip loca-
tion was defined as the midpoint of a Gaussian survival function 
fitted along the microtubule axis in a manually defined region 
of interest. However, in contrast to the tip of a single microtu-
bule, filopodia tips are not always best described by a single decay 
model. Rather, filopodia taper off as a result of spatial gradients in 
actin polymerization, possibly due to steric restriction of G-actin 
diffusion (Dobramysl et al., 2016). Thus, f-actin–labeled filopodia 
bundles may exhibit complex, multiple-decay intensity profiles. 
To localize filopodia endpoints with sufficient robustness, in a 
completely automated fashion, we use information regarding the 
local background intensity distribution (purple crosses) and the 
local minima (red) and maxima (green) in the slope of the inten-
sity profile to isolate an optimal region of the intensity profile for 
data fitting. Fig. 1 D (iii) shows two such complex decay profiles, 
while Fig. 1 C (ii) illustrates that a similar approach can be applied 
to identify the endpoint of a veil-embedded actin bundle.
GCA: Algorithmic details and segmentation parameters
Segmentation parameter overview
Table S1 defines the default segmentation parameters used for 
the N1E-115 data and provides recommendations for users. Block 
colors in both Fig. S2 and Table S1 indicate a specific segmenta-
tion step within the pipeline. Note that while all segmentation 
parameters are made accessible to the user, many required no 
adjustment to achieve quality segmentation of our diverse image 
set of 72 N1E-115 neurite movies. The one exception was the local 
threshold patch size, which needed a course adjustment to the 
GC thickness. Importantly , the default segmentation parameter 
settings for the filopodia reconstructions also produced good re-
sults when applying the pipeline to other GC models (Fig. 3, A–D; 
Fig. 4, C and D; Fig. S6; and Videos 7 and 8) and even to non-GC 
images (Fig. 3, E–G; and Fig. 4, E–G) with only minimal, intuitive 
adjustments, primarily to account for the differences in pixel size 
among the datasets. Full documentation of each step in the al-
gorithm and discussion of specific segmentation parameters are 
provided below . In addition, segmentation parameter files and 
corresponding images for reproducing Fig. 3 C and Fig. 4 (A–F) 
are included with the software release.
Detection of neurite stem and determination of 
neurite entrance point
Currently GCA is designed to segment the GC and a small por-
tion of the neurite stem, as this was the primary biological region 
of interest (Fig. 1). A small cropping tool to select this region of 
interest is included in the package. It is optional, and the only 
step requiring manual user input. The algorithm is then initi-
ated by a procedure that locates the neurite entrance point (black

stars in Fig. 1 B). For this to be successful, the cropping needs 
to ensure that some part of the neurite stem is included in the 
image sequence.
To identify stem-like regions of the neurite, GCA first filters 
the image using a multi-scale, fourth-order, steerable ridge filter 
(Jacob and Unser, 2004; Fig. S2, Step I). Ranges of sigma (σ) val-
ues defining the SDs of the Gaussian kernels on which the filters 
are based are set by the user via the segmentation parameter BB-
Scale (Table S1, Step I, i). The ridge filtering is performed on the 
entire image for each sigma value assigned in the BBScale vector. 
For all movies in this study , multi-scale ridge filtering was per-
formed using a sigma range of 5–10 pixels (∼1–2 µm) sampled at 
1-pixel intervals, which is tuned to find relatively large line struc-
tures such as the stem without response to finer structures such 
as filopodia. A multi-scale approach is required to accommodate 
stems of variable thickness. The final multi-scale ridge response 
map is computed by finding for each pixel the maximum filter 
response over all scales. A nonmaximum suppression (NMS; 
Canny , 1986; Jacob and Unser, 2004) is performed on this multi-
scale ridge response to identify the local maximum in the direc-
tion of the response gradient. The NMS map traces connected 
paths along the ridge-like portions of the veil/stem (orange lines, 
Fig. 1 B). Two ridge-cleaning steps are subsequently performed 
(Table S1, Step I, ii). First, an additional per-pixel thresholding of 
the NMS response is performed to remove very weak local-max-
imum ridge signals. The strictness of this threshold is dictated 
by a user adaptable parameter threshNMSResponse, set in this 
study to the 25th percentile of the total population of the NMS 
response values. Second, connected component objects from the 
final NMS ridge response less than MinCCRidgeBeforeConnect 
(set in this study to 3 pixels) are filtered, as it is difficult to extract 
high-confidence local orientation information, required for the 
subsequent connection step, in these cases.
If the veil/stem were a simple ridge with high signal to noise 
and invariant thickness, the NMS response map should trace 
a continuous path along the neurite. However, gaps along this 
path are expected in larger and/or more amorphous regions of 
the veil/stem where the ridge model is a poor assumption. (De-
tection of these amorphous regions will be addressed in the Veil/
Stem reconstruction section.) However, gaps can arise even in 
relatively thin ridge-like regions of the neurite due to inherent 
limitations of the ridge filter. Small, geometrically noncontinu-
ous gaps are often observed at sites where the neurite veil/stem 
abruptly changes thickness or the stem of the veil has very asym-
metric filopodia density along either side. Larger, typically more 
geometrically aligned gaps in the large-scale ridge response may 
be observed when the response is weak due to poor signal to noise 
of the original image or from subtle deviations of the image ob-
ject from the underlying ridge model. Therefore, we implement 
a linking step to bridge endpoints of connected components in 
the NMS map (Table S1, Step I, iii). The main goal of this step is 
to find rough connected component veil/stem paths leading from 
the neurite entrance point to each larger amorphous veil/stem 
structure. Accordingly , we allow relatively discontinuous linking 
geometries. If the gap distance is less than a user-defined cut-
off radius, MaxRadiusNoGeoTerm, set in this study to 3 pixels 
(∼0.6 µm), connected components are linked regardless of the 
attachment geometry . Gaps with distances greater than MaxRa-
diusNoGeoTerm, but below a user adaptable cut-off, MaxRadi-
usLargeScaleLink, are bridged only if the respective connected 
components fulfill the constraint, that the angle (θRL) between 
the linking vector (L) and the local orientation vector at the con-
nected component endpoint (R) does not exceed the value Geo-
Thresh, in this study set to a lenient 90°. Potential links within 
a MaxRadiusLargeScaleLink (set to 10 pixels [∼ 2 µm] in this 
study) are found using a K-dimensional tree and linear linker 
path interpolated between candidate endpoints. To ensure only 
a single linkage for each ridge endpoint, a maximum weighted 
graph matching step (Avis, 1983; Kolmogorov , 2009) is performed 
using weights based upon distance only if the distance is below 
the MaxRadiusNoGeoTerm, or based on distance and geometry if 
the linkage distance is greater than MaxRadiusNoGeoTerm and 
less than MaxRadiusLargeScaleLink. After this initial linking 
step, detected endpoints of thick ridge candidates within Max-
DistBorderFirstTry (10 pixels [∼2 µm] in our study) from the 
image edge are chosen as potential neurite stem entrance ridge 
candidates (Table S1, Step I, iv). The software assumes a reason-
able entrance candidate for each frame of the movie exists; there-
fore, while MaxDistBorderFirstTry is technically a user-defined 
parameter, the value is widened automatically if no ridge can-
didate in a given frame meets this initial criterion. If more than 
one ridge candidate is found, such as is shown in (Fig. 1 B, i), the 
algorithm first filters candidate ridges based on length alone, as 
defined by the user-adaptable parameter MinCCEntranceRidge-
FirstTry (set in our study to 5 pixels), in order to filter out any 
potential high-intensity noise. Using a summation of the mean 
fluorescence intensity (FI) and the length of the ridge candidate 
as a score, the program then determines on a per-frame basis 
which candidate ridge path most likely corresponds to the en-
tering neurite stem. Occasionally , an incorrect ridge candidate is 
chosen as the neurite entrance ridge. As the orientation of the en-
tering neurite stem within the image does not move significantly 
during the time resolution of interest in this study (total movie 
time ∼10 min), the correct orientation of the neurite within all 
images is the most frequent orientation of the automatically de-
termined seed ridge for the entire movie. Frames in which the 
selected seed ridge fails to correspond with the majority neurite 
orientation for the movie—for example, due to a transient dis-
tracter object entering the image such as in Fig. 1 B , i—are cor-
rected in a subsequent step so that the seed ridges for all frames 
are consistent (Fig. S2 and Table S1, Step II). This is accomplished 
by simply performing a crude spatial clustering via dilation of a 
logical mask marking all the estimated neurite entrance points 
by an input radius SizeOfConsistencyRestraint (default is 5 pix-
els). This dilation is then separated into connected components, 
and the connected component with the majority of frames is cho-
sen as the correct neurite orientation cluster. The program then 
combines all the ridge neurite stem candidates from the majority 
cluster that are found in more than five frames as a base neur-
ite orientation path. The best ridge candidate from the outlier 
frame that aligns to this path is then chosen as the new neurite 
entrance stem from which to build the veil/stem estimate in that 
frame. GCA has an optional visual quality control step, allowing 
the user to check the final neurite orientation selected for the

movie (the checkOrient option; Table S1, Step II). If users see the 
wrong neurite entrance region is selected from the majority vote, 
they can select the correct entrance ridge to which the movie is 
aligned by the process described above. This feature also can 
help choose the correct SizeOfConsistencyRestraint. However, 
we found this manual refinement was typically not necessary 
as long as a distractor element, such as another GC, was absent 
or relatively transient. For example, incorrect entrance ridges in 
the movie corresponding to Fig. 1 B (i) were corrected automati-
cally by the algorithm without any need for manual refinement. 
Notably , none of the datasets analyzed in this study , including 
the data of Fig. 3 (A–D), Fig. 4 (C and D), or Fig. S6, required this 
manual refinement.
Veil/Stem reconstruction
Gaps along the ridge path are expected in larger and/or more 
amorphous regions of the veil/stem where the ridge model is a 
poor assumption. A practical solution is to simply detect these 
more amorphous regions using local intensity Otsu thresholding 
(Niblack, 1985), a variant of traditional Otsu thresholding (Otsu, 
1979), which allows for differences in the value of the intensity 
threshold per pixel throughout the image, depending on the in-
tensity profile of the local surrounding region (Fig. S2, Step III). 
The size of the local region is controlled by the segmentation 
parameter LocalThresholdPatchSize (Table S1, Step III, i), which 
was set between 30 and 100 pixels in this study for the N1E-115 
dataset, depending on the size of the GC (larger GCs required 
larger patch sizes). The default value is set to 75 pixels. Notably , 
global thresholding rather than local thresholding (Table S1, Step 
III, i) helped avoid over-emphasizing intracellular inhomogene-
ity associated with some datasets. Ultimately the method most 
appropriate here will depend upon the characteristic intensity 
distribution of a given imaging modality . Therefore, several dif-
ferent initial thresholding methods are made available for this 
step, as well as an option to import an externally generated mask 
(Table S1, Step III, i). Notably, this initial thresholding step is 
indeed the most likely segmentation parameter that may need 
modification/troubleshooting when applying GCA to a novel 
dataset. Importantly, however, as in GCA the main goal of this 
initial thresholding step is to find a reasonable detection of the 
veil and not the lower intensity filopodia, the final segmentation 
becomes less sensitive to this step as compared with other meth-
ods (Fig. 4, A–C, ii; Tsygankov et al., 2014; Urbančič et al., 2017). 
This vastly facilitates the segmentation parameter optimization. 
Low-fidelity information corresponding to filopodia from the bi-
narization achieved via the initial thresholding step is removed 
via morphological opening (Maitre, 2008). Here morphological 
opening was performed using the imopen function included in 
MAT LAB’s image processing toolbox, using the strel function to 
create a disk structuring element of a user-defined radius dic-
tated by the veil/stem segmentation parameter DiskSizeLarge, 
set to 6 pixels (∼1.3 µm) for segmentation of all the GFP LifeAct 
images in this study (Table S1, Step III, ii). Note that in the case 
of the LifeAct images we found it worked best to keep the struc-
turing disk for this morphological operation slightly larger than 
the true scale of the filopodia objects we aimed to remove, as re-
sidual fluorescence and overlapping filopodia are often merged/
under-thresholded, leading to low-fidelity noise in the binary 
image thicker than a single filopodium. This was less of a prob-
lem in the case of the membrane-labeled images (recommended 
DiskSizeLarge is 4 pixels [∼0.86 µm] for the N1E-115 images), as 
filopodia exhibited lower signal to noise and thus were typically 
not detected by the local thresholding. However, morphological 
operations using larger disk sizes begin to remove thin pieces of 
the neurite stem/veil path, breaking connectivity. To maintain 
maximal connectivity along the veil stem path, we use geomet-
ric information to adapt the local disk size of the morphological 
operation employed in select regions of the neurite. We reasoned 
that ill-detected, thick filopodia/branch bundles, which we wish 
to remove in this step, and thinner portions of the veil/stem (Fig. 
S1 C, iii), which we wish to preserve, can be deciphered based on 
their connectivity with respect to the thicker regions of the neu-
rite. Therefore, the algorithm scans for simple connected com-
ponent paths of the neurite removed by morphological openings 
that span two larger-size veil/stem “pieces” in the binary thresh-
old image. In these regions, the size of the structuring element is 
reduced to the user-defined radius DiskSizeSmall (Table S2, Step 
III, ii) set to 3 pixels (∼0.65 µm) for the N1E-115 dataset.
The neurite entrance ridge is then combined with the veil 
pieces detected via the initial thresholding/morphological open-
ing step. All veil pieces overlapping the neurite entrance ridge 
are maintained. Subsequently , all ridge pieces overlapping with 
these selected veil pieces are added to the veil/stem detection. 
Any ridge detections within MaxRadiusBridgeRidges (set in this 
study to 5 pixels, ∼1 µm; Table S1, Step III, iii) of all veil/stem de-
tection endpoints are linked to the current veil/stem detection. 
The process iterates until no more veil pieces overlap with the 
final veil/stem detection. When the reconstruction is complete, 
any endpoints, other than the neurite entrance point (black star 
in Fig. 1 B), of the veil/stem detection are eroded to create the final 
veil/stem mask (Fig. 1 B, far right panels, green outlines). The veil 
pieces are treated as nodes on a graph whose edges are defined by 
the detected thick ridges (potential stems). Only ridge detections 
spanning two separate veil nodes are maintained. Occasionally 
cycles are formed in this veil/stem graph (Fig. 1 B, iii), and these 
are resolved by solving for a minimal spanning tree (Prim, 1957) 
where the weights of the edges are dictated by the scale (i.e., 
thickness) and filter response strength of the connecting large-
scale ridge, as well as its underlying original image intensity (Fig. 
S2, Step III). As the NMS only marks the central line of the stem, 
without providing information of the thickness/localization of 
the stem edges, remaining stem detections are dilated using MAT 
LAB’s imdilate function included in MAT LAB’s image processing 
toolbox, using the strel function to create a disk-structuring el-
ement with a radius set to 4 pixels (∼ 864 nm). (See Video 2 for 
a visual summary of these iterative steps for four example GCs 
with diverse morphology .)
Neurite length measurements
Given the morphological heterogeneity between GCs as well as 
the morphological variation over time, it is prohibitive to use the 
GC centroid for tracking neurite length changes, as was done pre-
viously (Tsygankov et al., 2014). We instead use the properties 
of veil/stem segmentation to obtain more robust neurite length

measurements over time. We assume neurite length to extend 
from the entrance point to the tip of the leading veil protrusion 
(Fig.  5, A and B). This measurement can be achieved through 
skeletonization of the veil/stem (Fig. S2, Step IV). We used the 
“skel” operation of MAT LAB’s bwmorph function. The skeleton is 
converted to a graph representation, where each node represents 
a pixel in the skeleton with a nearest neighbor number either 
equal to 1 (endpoint vertices) or greater than 2 (branch vertices). 
The shortest path through the skeleton graph from the neurite 
entrance point to each endpoint vertex of the skeleton (marking 
approximately the convex endpoint of a veil/stem protrusion) is 
calculated, and the longest of these paths is then chosen as the 
neurite length measurement for the given frame (Fig. 5 A, orange 
line). Note in a system of high symmetry there can be fluctuations 
in the orientation of the longest path from one frame to another 
as the neurite makes a directional decision. However, the overall 
neurite length outgrowth metric velocity can remain constant.
Optional veil/stem refinement step
Once the neurite length measurements are extracted (as de-
scribed in the previous section), identification of outlier data 
points within an individual neurite outgrowth time series can 
serve as an automated indicator of segmentation error. There -
fore, GCA includes an optional step (Fig. S2, Step V) to flag prob-
able segmentation error frames, as indicated by an outlier veil/
stem length measurement and the presence of a high-intensity 
floating “veil piece,” initially excluded from the final veil/stem 
segmentation due to failure to find a viable stem attachment path 
during reconstruction. While the exclusion of these detected 
“veil pieces” is desirable in certain cases—for instance, when 
there is surrounding high FI debris, or when the GC of interest 
is in the presence of a neighboring neurite (Fig. 1 B , i)—a coin-
cident length outlier flag indicates a potential veil/stem trunca-
tion, which may be caused by limitations of the ridge filter at 
larger sigma values. For these identified frames, the longest path 
of the veil/stem skeleton in the frames toutlier + 1 and toutlier − 1 are 
combined, thinned, and then used in an attempt to bridge the 
previously excluded veil/stem piece and correct the segmenta-
tion for the outlier frame. All veil/stem masks calculated in this 
study were visually verified. Such truncations were infrequent 
and typically caused by dense, asymmetric filopodia distribu-
tions along one side of the stem to be detected. Notably , only two 
movies in this study required veil/stem refinement via this step, 
and therefore by default it is an optional step in the GCA pipeline.
Filopodia candidate detection
Filopodia-like structures were identified using the same 
fourth-order steerable ridge detector (Jacob and Unser, 2004) as 
for ridge identification, but applied using a single, much smaller 
Gaussian sigma value, set by the segmentation parameter Filo-
Scale (Table S1, Step VI, i, in this study 1.5 pixels [324 nm]). The 
filter step was followed by an NMS step (Canny , 1986; Jacob and 
Unser, 2004) to isolate the center line of the filopodia images.
With smaller sigma Gaussians underlying the steerable filter, 
the responses tend to be noisier, requiring stringent filtering of 
false positives in the NMS map. Therefore, GCA takes a number of 
practical measures to limit the number of false-positive filopodia 
segments that are entered into the subsequent filopodia/branch 
optimization steps. First, a permissive threshold of the image 
intensity histogram estimates a rough background mask of the 
image, leaving a permissive filopodia search area surrounding 
each object, threshold: (μInt_Noise + 2σInt_Noise), where μInt_Noise and 
σInt_Noise are the mean and the SD, respectively , of the fit to the 
first Gaussian. These object masks can be cleaned and dilated if 
necessary if the filopodia search region surrounding the object 
is too small (i.e., the background mask is overestimated). This 
is an optional step (filterBackEst) in the pipeline (Table S1, Step 
VI, ii), but it is recommended to save computational time and to 
quickly avoid possible false-positive branch structures. Second, 
we applied a threshold directly upon the NMS values. We found a 
threshold of (μNoiseNMSResponse + 3σNoiseNMSResponse) performed well, 
where μNoiseNMSResponse and σNoiseNMSResponse are the mean and the 
SD, respectively , of the fit to the first Gaussian of the probability 
density function corresponding to the nonzero response values 
from the NMS. This value was sufficient for a majority of our 
needs in this study when combined with the above object-mask-
ing step. However, this value can be adjusted by the parameter 
multSTD NMSResponse (Table S1, Step VI, ii), and several quick 
automated checks are included in the software to check the integ-
rity of these initial thresholds on the response values. If flagged, 
the software attempts a different thresholding method automat-
ically , which may perform better given the shape of the intensity 
histogram. After thresholding, the NMS image is binarized, and 
any remaining branch/higher-order junctions are broken to ob-
tain curvilinear ridge pieces that can be grouped in subsequent 
steps. Note that junctions typically show weak steerable ridge 
filter responses since they represent points in the image where 
the orientation of the ridge structure is ambiguous, and hence 
they are not typically well detected by the steerable filter. The 
subsequent filopodia/branch reconstruction steps resolve this 
problem (see below). In addition, ridge pieces ≤3 pixels (0.65 
µm; segmentation parameter minCCRidge; Table S1, Step VI, 
ii) are removed from the NMS map, as the geometric measure-
ments of these pieces, required for subsequent linking steps, are 
too uncertain. To classify this pool of segments into veil-exposed 
filopodia (Fig. 1 A, vi and vii) versus veil-embedded actin bundle 
candidates (orange lines, Fig. 1 C, i), we used the veil/stem mask 
and considered veil-exposed candidates connected directly to the 
mask as high-confidence filopodia detections. The combination 
of veil/stem edge pixels and their connected filopodia detections 
were subsequently used as a “high-confidence seed“ ( Fig. 1 A, 
vii) for further filopodia candidate reattachment in the Filopo-
dia/Branch Reconstruction and Optional Veil-Embedded Actin 
Bundle Detection modules documented below .
We also considered veil-exposed filopodia candidates not di-
rectly attached to the veil/stem mask. We reasoned that the pop-
ulation of connected candidates provided a distribution of filter 
response values representative for bona fide filopodia detections. 
Therefore, to remove weak filopodia candidates from the unat-
tached candidate pool, we removed segments of less than 10 pix-
els in length or with a mean ridge filter response less than the 
fifth percentile of the veil/stem-attached filopodia distribution. 
Note this filtering step can be skipped by the user if the number 
of veil-attached filopodia is too small to obtain an estimate of the

distribution. For example, this filtering step is not applicable in 
the case of a single dendritic filopodium (Fig. 4 G). The compila-
tion of these initial selection steps produced the final unattached 
filopodia candidates as shown as orange lines in Fig. 1 A (vi).
Filopodia/Branch reconstruction
The filopodia segments were entered into the filopodia building 
step in which neighboring, linearly continuous fragments were 
merged (Fig. 1 A, vi). Candidates for merging were selected by 
finding matching endpoints within the distance defined by max-
RadiusLink (set in this study to 5 pixels, ∼ 1 µm) using a K-di-
mensional tree search. Between potential matching endpoints, 
linear paths were then interpolated, and the link orientation 
represented by a unit-length vector. To determine the continu-
ity between the filopodia segments and their corresponding link, 
the angle, θFL, between the link vector and the local orientation 
at the filopodia segment endpoint (black and orange arrows, re-
spectively , in Fig. 1 A, vi) was calculated for each endpoint. While 
two θFL values, θFLij and θFLji, were calculated for each possible 
link, a single θFLij calculation is illustrated in Fig. 1 A (vi) for clar-
ity . The tolerance with which links are allowed to deviate from 
perfect continuation (θFLij = 0°) is controlled by the parameter 
geoThresh (set in this study to θFL = ∼25° [cosθFL = 0.9]; Table 
S1, Step IV , iii). Hence, any endpoint whose local orientation vec-
tor and corresponding link vector formed an angle θFL > 25° was 
not considered for merging. Typically , only a single possible link 
between two endpoints fulfilled the stringent criteria for link 
selection. However, occasionally multiple links competed for 
the same endpoint. To ensure that each endpoint was associated 
with no more than one link, we formulated the link assignment 
as a maximum weighted graph matching problem (Avis, 1983; 
Kolmogorov , 2009). Each endpoint under consideration defines 
a node on the graph, and each interpolated link a graph edge. To 
calculate the weights, distances dij between candidate endpoints 
were converted to distance scores  score  D  ij    = max   (  D )    −  d  ij   , where 
Dij represents the full set of dij values for a given frame. This con-
version ensured that larger dij values result in smaller weights.
The scores Dij were then normalized as
 score  D  ij     ′   =     
score  D  ij  
 ___________ max   (  score  D  ij   )     ,   
where scoreDij′ is the final normalized distance score.
Weights of edges between two endpoints, i and j, were derived 
by simple summation of the normalized distance score Dij and the 
dot products between link orientation and local filopodia orien-
tation in at each candidate endpoint:
  W  ij   = score  D  ij     ′   + cos   (   θFL  ij   )    + cos   (   θFL  ji   )   . 
Application of a maximum weighted matching to this graph 
determines which filopodia candidates are merged into a 
single candidate.
The final filopodia/branch reconstruction was then achieved 
by combining information from this new set of merged filopodia 
candidates (Fig. 1 A, vi) and the “high-confidence seed” (Fig. 1 A, 
vii), comprised of both the veil/stem edge pixels and its con-
nected filopodia detections. Akin to the preceding filopodia can-
didate building step, we formulated a graph matching problem 
(Fig. 1 A, viii; Fig. S3; and Video 3): all pixels of the “seed” within 
a user-defined search radius maxRadiusConnectFiloBranch,  
set to 15 pixels, ∼3.2 µm in our study (Table S1, Step VI, iv), sur-
rounding each filopodia endpoint were selected (Fig. S3 A, ii and 
iii). Linear paths are interpolated between candidate endpoints 
and all seed pixels using the Bresenham algorithm. These paths 
become the edges, and each graph node is either a single filopo-
dia candidate or a pixel on the “seed” (Fig. S3 A, iii). In the sec-
ond step (Fig. S3 B), weights are calculated for each path. These 
weights were designed to reflect that a path is more likely if (1) 
the Euclidean distance of the path is low , (2) the mean intensity 
of pixels along the path is high, and (3) the linkage results in a 
geometrically reasonable structure given the biophysical prop-
erties of actin filaments.
Specifically , geometric continuity between each filopodia 
candidate and each putative linkage was assessed by calculating 
the dot product of the unit vectors representing the the local ori-
entation of the candidate filopodia in its endpoint and the direc-
tion of the linkage path. Given the relatively linear geometry of 
actin bundles of interest, dot products corresponding to an angle 
greater than the geoThreshFiloBranch segmentation parameter, 
set in this study to θFL = 60° (Table S1, Step VI, iv), were filtered 
before the final graph matching step (Fig. S3 B, i and ii). Any 
paths that crossed the veil/stem mask and/or crossed another 
ridge/candidate were likewise removed.
Similar to the preceding filopodia/ridge candidate building 
step, all individual distances, dij, between potential graph nodes 
were converted to individual distance scores  score  D  ij     = max   
(  D )    −  d  ij   , where D represents the full population of dij values 
for a given frame, for a given reconstruction iteration, before 
geometry-based path filtering (Fig. S3 B, i and ii). This conver-
sion ensures that larger dij values result in a smaller scoreDij. 
scoreDijs were then normalized such that the maximum 
scoreDij is equal to 1,
  score  D  ij     ′   =     
score  D  ij  
 ___________ max   (  score  D  ij   )     ,   
where scoreDij′ is the final normalized distance score (Fig. S3 B, iii).
Unlike in the filopodia candidate building step, the graph 
weights corresponding to the final filopodia/branch reconstruc-
tion steps also accounted for the mean FI of each path. To this 
end, we calculated the mean FI ImeanPerPathij of a single path 
from graph node i, a ridge candidate endpoint, to graph node j, a 
pixel on the seed, and normalized the value such that the full pop-
ulation of potential paths maintained a value between 0 and 1:
 Score  I  ij     ′   =     
 [   ImeanPerPath  ij     − min   (  ImeanPerPath )    ]  
   _________________________________    [  max   (  ImeanPerPath )    − min   (  ImeanPerPath )    ]    . 
Here, ImeanPerPath denotes the full distribution of path in-
tensity mean values in a frame for a given filopodia/branch 
reconstruction iteration, and min(ImeanPerPath) and max(Ime-
anPerPath) denote the minimum and maximum values of this 
distribution, respectively .
Finally, the absolute value of the unit dot product correspond-
ing to the local orientation vectors at the site of the filopodia 
segment endpoint (F) and the site of attachment to the seed (S), 
|cosθFSij|, was calculated.

Quantification of heterogeneity among growth cones

The final weight (Fig. S3 B, vi), Wij, for each path was com-
piled by weighted summation of the above scores (Fig. S3 B, 
ii–v), such that
  W  ij   = 0.5  (  ScoreDi j ′   )    + Score  I  ij     ′   +   |  cos θFSij |    + cos θF  L  ij  . 
Weight values typically approached a Gaussian distribution 
(Fig. 3 B, vi, bottom). The maximum weighted graph matching 
step (Avis, 1983; Kolmogorov , 2009) solves the graph by choos-
ing a subset of edges (black paths in Fig. S3 C) that maximizes 
the sum of the weights of the edges subject to each node being 
connected to another node not more than once. As each ridge 
candidate is considered a single node in the graph (Fig. S3 A, i) 
this formulation forces only a single optimized link to be chosen 
between filopodia segment and seed (Fig. S3 C). The attached 
fragments are then assigned labels based on their attachment 
site (Fig. 1 A, viii) and become part of the next iteration’s seed. 
The above steps iterate until no pixels in the current seed set fall 
within maxRadiusConnectFiloBranch of the remaining candi-
date filopodia segment endpoints (Video 3).
Optional veil-embedded actin bundle detection
Veil-embedded actin bundle candidates, as defined in the Filo-
podia Candidate Detection Step , were first cleaned using MAT  
LAB’s bwmorph “spur” option (2 pixels). Any candidates without 
two well-defined endpoints were discarded. The endpoint closest 
to the veil/stem edge for both the exposed and embedded actin 
bundle candidate was chosen for potential matching. Any em-
bedded actin bundles with endpoints equidistant from the veil/
stem edge were discarded, as it was typically an indication that 
these ridge candidates corresponded to signal generated from 
the veil/stem edge itself. To further solve the problem of false- 
positive actin bundle detection, we also included a step that 
breaks the embedded ridge candidates at sites surpassing a user- 
defined curvature, curvBreakCandEmbed (Table S1, Step VI, v; 
set in this study to 0.05 1/pixels). This enforces the assumption 
that true embedded candidate ridges of interest are linear. If one 
wishes to detect more noncanonical highly curved embedded 
structures, one can simply set this value to 0, though at the po-
tential risk of an increased false-positive rate.
All embedded actin-bundle, ridge candidate endpoints (or-
ange lines in Fig. 1 C, i) within a 10-pixel (2.16-µm) radius of 
the high-confidence exposed filopodia seed points (green lines 
in Fig. 1 C , i) were found using a K-dimensional tree search. 
Although this study kept the radius fixed for all datasets, the 
software allows user adjustments via the segmentation param-
eter maxRadiusLinkEmbedded  (Table S1, Step VI, v). Similar 
to the filopodia candidate building step (Fig. 1 A, vi), and the 
geometry filtering step of the main filopodia/branch recon-
struction (Fig. S3 B, i and v), only connections exhibiting a 
linking geometry conforming to the specifications defined by 
the geoThreshEmbedded  segmentation parameter (θ FL = 60° 
in this study; Table S1, Step VI, v) were considered for link -
ing. Again, to ensure only one linkage is maintained between 
two ridge candidate endpoints, the assignment problem was 
formulated as a maximum weighted graph matching problem 
(Avis, 1983; Kolmogorov , 2009), such that each endpoint under 
consideration corresponds to a node on the graph, and each 
interpolated linkage a graph edge path. In this case, weights, 
Wij, of individual edge paths were based completely on linkage 
geometry , such that
  W  ij   = cos   (  θF  L  ij   )    + cos   (  θF  L  ji   )   . 
Of note, distance was not included in the weight. We empirically 
observed that confounding ridge signal corresponding to intra-
cellular noise and the veil/stem edge frequently caused breaks 
along the ridge NMS extracted for the exposed filopodia ridge 
population. This, combined with generally lower ridge responses 
inside the image of the cytoplasm, often produced truncated ridge 
candidates with relatively large distance gaps between correct 
pairings. Hence, we reasoned in this case that geometry alone 
was the most reliable indicator of a high-fidelity link. Note that 
this framework allows only those embedded actin bundles with 
a veil-exposed filopodium counterpart to be detected (Fig. S5 C).
Filopodia endpoint localization
The thresholded steerable filter response of a filopodium pro-
vides only an inaccurate estimate of its endpoint, both because 
of the often weak signal in these regions, and because any signal 
at the ridge end inherently deviates from the geometric model 
underlying the detector, which assumes the ridge to be of infinite 
length. This may result in either an over- or underestimation 
of the true filopodia length. To improve on the tip localization, 
the local directional vector, identified from the steerable filter 
response, was employed to extrapolate each putative filopodia 
region by 10 pixels (∼2 µm). Examples of these extrapolated re-
gions are shown in purple in Fig. 1 A (ix) and Fig. 1 D (iii) and are 
combined with the original filament fragment detection (green) 
to create a mask localizing the approximate region of each fila-
ment. For visualization, and to estimate the local intensity back-
ground surrounding a filopodium, each filament mask included 
±2 pixels (∼0.4 µm) perpendicular to the filament’s centerline 
(achieved via the NMS of the steerable filter response or via 
the extrapolation step above). Image extraction from these re-
gional masks confirmed good localization of filopodia centerline 
by the ridge detection followed by NMS thresholding (Fig. 1, A 
[ix] and D [iii]).
A weighted average of the pixel intensity values (not limited 
by the above mask), based upon the point spread function (PSF) 
of the microscope, was extracted for each pixel on the filament 
fragment’s backbone (Fig. 1, A  [ix] and D [iii]). As the fluores-
cence decay of actin bundles can be complex (Fig. 1 D, iii), a series 
of steps was then employed to localize the region of each linescan 
corresponding to the first significant fluorescence signal decay . 
Specifically , we subjected a smoothened version of the signal’s 
derivative (obtained via cspas in MAT LAB, P = 0.1) to MAT LAB’s 
findpeaks function to locate the corresponding local minimum 
and maximum, denoted as green and red dots, respectively, in 
Fig. 1, A (ix) and D (iii).
The local background surrounding the filopodium was es-
timated using the extrapolated region of the filopodium mask 
(purple in Fig. 1, A [ix] and D [iii]). The center line of the pro-
jection mask was not included in the filament’s intensity back -
ground estimation. The first maximally decreasing region with 
signal above the mean of this background estimate was isolated,

and signal within ±10 pixels (approximately ±2.14 µm) of this 
value was isolated for the final least-squares regression fitting 
of the intensity values. The maximum window size for least-
squares regression can be modulated by the maxWindForLSQFit 
segmentation parameter (Table S1, Step VII). However, this win-
dow is currently partially self-adaptive. If a second maximally 
decreasing region is found within the initial window size, the val-
ues used for the least-squares regression are truncated to exclude 
these portions (Fig. 1 D, iii), as this typically indicates a second 
confounding intensity decay . The final window of the intensity 
profile is then fit to a Gaussian survival function (below equa -
tion) using the lsqcurvefit function in MAT LAB:
 I  (   x ″   )    =   1 _ 2    I  Fil    erfc  (     x ″   −  μ  Fil   _  √ 
_
 2    σ   (  Fil+PSF )       )    +  I  BG  . 
Here I(x″) denotes the portion of the filament intensity profile, 
x″ is the distance along the filament bundle, IFil is the amplitude 
of the filament intensity above the mean background IBG, μ Fil 
corresponds to the mean value for the filament endpoint mea-
surement, and σ(Fil + PSF) corresponds to the combined SD in the 
filament endpoint localization due to both the filament’s physical 
structure (Fil) and the PSF of the microscope.
GCA: Feature extraction
Integrated with GCA are a number of functions that extract from 
the segmented veil and filopodia morphological features for 
classification of GC behaviors. Importantly , GCA users are en-
couraged to define their own features. In the following sections, 
we define the morphological and morphodynamic features em-
ployed for the GC analysis in Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Neurite length
We use neurite length as our primary feature describing GC 
function. It is defined as the longest path through the veil/stem 
skeleton as shown in Fig. 5 A. Further details are provided in the 
Neurite length measurements subsection under the GCA: Algo-
rithmic details and segmentation parameters section.
Veil/Stem thickness
An illustration of the veil/stem thickness metric is shown in 
Fig. 5 B . The veil/stem thickness is defined as the mean of the 
Euclidian distance transform values along the longest path of the 
veil/stem skeleton, from the tip of the leading protrusion to a us-
er-selected length (default 20 µm). The distance transform of the 
veil/stem binary mask was calculated using bwdist in MAT LAB.
Veil/Stem dynamic features
Using the veil/stem detection mask (Fig. 1 A, iii), protrusion vec-
tor calculations and edge sector averaging of vectors were per-
formed as described previously (Ma et al., 2018).
Specifically , cell edge velocities were derived from pixel-
by-pixel matching of cell contours between consecutive time 
points. A B-form spline was fitted to the edge pixel positions 
of the segmented cell area, with nodes corresponding to each 
edge pixel. The spline representations of two consecutive 
frames were then divided into segments between their inter-
sections. To map a correspondence between the edge splines on 
consecutive frames, the following objective function was itera-
tively minimized as:

The variable n denotes the number of nodes, which in the ab-
sence of down-sampling (see below) is equal to the number of 
edge pixels in that segment. p1,2,...n(t) are the parameters of the 
spline at time t defining equally spaced edge nodes x(t,pi), one 
at each edge pixel. The goal of Eqs. 1 and 2 is to identify n spline 
parameters o1,2...n(t+1) in between the intersection points e1 and 
en that define nonequally spaced nodes x(t+1,oi) at t+1 such that 
the overall displacement (SUMA) and strain, i.e., changes in spac-
ing of nodes (SUMB), is minimized. Eq. 2 imposes the constraint 
to the minimization that displacement vectors must not cross. 
The two sums in Eq. 1 have different physical units. To balance 
them correctly , a factor ω is introduced as follows:

The factor ω is calculated only in the first iteration of the minimi-
zation, as the unit conversion by the ratio SUMA = SUMB changes 
insubstantially thereafter. The parameter w is a free user-control 
that allows the definition of the trade-off between minimal edge 
displacement and minimal lateral strain.
The minimization of Eq. 1 can be computationally costly when 
the number of edge pixels in a segment exceeds 100. To circum-
vent this problem, a control parameter 10 < Nmax < 100 is intro-
duced. When the number of edge pixels in a segment is greater 
than Nmax, the number of nodes to Nmax is downsampled, and 
the boundary displacement for this number of nodes is calcu-
lated and then upsampled to the original number of edge pixels 
by interpolation. Once the boundary displacements are identi-
fied, the projections of these displacements onto the boundary 
normal vector are calculated to obtain a signed local measure-
ment of the instantaneous normal edge velocity .
Edge sector numbering was initiated in each frame at the 
detected neurite entrance point (Fig. 1 B , black star). Propaga-
tion of this origin was set to false. Edge sectors were propagated 
using the “ConstantNumber” method, whereby the number of 
sampling edge sectors are held constant, allowing the width of 
each sector to vary as the length of the cell edge changes. The 
initial size of each edge sector, parallel to the cell edge, was set 
to ∼5 pixels (∼1.0 µm for the N1E-115 GC images). Edge sectors 
were reinitiated midway through the movie (frame 61) to help

limit sector tracking errors. As extreme changes in the local veil 
velocity are predominately associated with rare veil/stem edge 
segmentation errors, to limit veil velocity analysis artifacts, out-
lier data points approximately greater than six times the mean 
were detected (Rousseeuw and Leroy, 1987) and removed for each 
veil velocity time series before further analysis (black crosses in 
Fig. 5 B, iii, indicate outlier data points). The velocity traces for 
each segment (Fig. 5 B, iii) were then processed as described pre-
viously (Mendoza et al., 2015), using a signal detection algorithm 
on the basis of empirical mode decomposition (Huang and Shen, 
2014). Velocities within the noise level were classified as insig-
nificant and the respective edge segment as inactive (Fig. 5 B, iv 
and v). Once a significant event was detected, it was classified 
as either protrusion or retraction, and the mean values were ex-
tracted. The event duration was also measured.
Design of filopodia/branch segment filters for feature extraction
Before any feature extraction, GCA ’s workflow allows the user 
to design a filopodia/branch filter based on segment length (de-
fined as μFilo, Fig. 1 A, ix), the quality of the intensity profile 
regression, as measured by IFilo compared with the residuals of 
the fitted data points (Fig. 1 A, ix), and segment branching order, 
such that order = 0 (veil-attached, no branch detected), order = 1 
(veil-attached segment, with branch), order = 2 (branch segment 
attached to veil-attached segment type 1), order = 3 (branch at-
tached to branch segment type 2), etc. (Fig. 5 D, top). Unless oth-
erwise noted, segments with an μFilo length less than 0.3 µm and 
an IFilo amplitude less than the 95th percentile of the residuals 
from the intensity fit were excluded. For select features, these 
filter criteria were relaxed slightly as explained in the respective 
feature descriptions below .
Filopodia length
Filopodia lengths can be potentially calculated in two different 
ways using the intensity profile (Fig. 1 A, ix) fit information. One 
option, used in this study , is to use the value of μFil as the termi-
nation site of the filament and not consider variation in potential 
filament tapering that may be reflected in the SD of the fit. The 
second option is to use μ Fil + σ (Fil+PSF) as the sub-pixel filament 
termination point. While both metrics are reasonable, using 
μFil + σ(Fil+PSF) may yield filopodia lengths that are visually more 
satisfying. As filaments exhibiting a large σ, potentially due to 
excessive tapering of the actin bundle, may look visually under-
estimated if only the μ of the fit is displayed.
Unless otherwise noted, filopodia lengths were calculated 
from both branching and nonbranching veil/attached segments 
(branch order equal to either 0 or 1). Filopodia length was defined 
as the distance from μFil of the fitted segment outside the veil, to 
the detected veil/stem, as traced along the NMS of the ridge filter 
response (Fig. 5 C).
Embedded actin bundle length
An additional filter step removed embedded actin bundle seg-
ments from the feature distribution if their corresponding ex -
tra-veil filopodia segment failed to meet the confidence criteria of 
the filter. Embedded actin bundle length was calculated as the dis-
tance from μFil of the fitted segment inside the veil to the detected 
veil/stem, as traced along the NMS of the ridge filter response 
(Fig. 5 C). If no embedded segment of the filopodia was detected, 
or the detected segment did not meet the filter criteria, the embed-
ded actin bundle length is set to 0. Only nonzero embedded actin 
bundle lengths were pooled for the distribution calculations in 
Fig. 6 (C and D), Fig. 7 A, and Fig. 8 B. Note, a fluorescent actin label, 
such as LifeAct GFP , is required for the calculation of this feature.
Full actin bundle length
Full actin bundle lengths were measured from both branching 
and nonbranching veil/attached segments (branch order equal 
to either 0 or 1), and calculated as the summation of the filopodia 
length and the embedded actin bundle length as defined in the 
above sections (Fig. 5 C). If no embedded segment of the filopo-
dia was detected, or the detected segment did not meet the filter 
criteria, the embedded actin bundle length is set to 0.
Percent length each actin bundle veil embedded
The percentage each actin bundle veil embedded was calculated 
by dividing the embedded actin bundle length by the length of 
the full actin bundle (as defined in the above sections). Actin 
bundles with no significant veil-embedment (0 values) were ex-
cluded from this feature distribution, as a majority of detected 
filopodia do not have an embedded actin bundle counterpart and 
inclusion of these values skew the feature distribution to 0.
Branch length
Branch lengths were measured from second order branch seg-
ments only , and defined as the distance from μFil of the second 
order fitted branch segment, to its site of attachment along its re-
spective first order branch, as traced along the NMS of the ridge 
filter response (Fig. 5 D).
Filopodia/Branch curvature
Detected filopodia/branch backbone coordinates obtained via 
the NMS of the steerable filter response were first smoothed 
using the spaps function in MAT LAB, setting the tolerance pa -
rameter equal to 2. The local curvature was calculated at each 
pixel by fitting polygons to each of the filopodia backbone co-
ordinates and solving for the curvature analytically from the 
polygons. The maximum curvature value along the length of the 
filopodia/branch (as defined in the Filopodia length and Branch 
length sections above) was recorded (Fig. 5 C, black arrows).
Filopodia/Branch LifeAct FI
For each detected segment of the filopodium/branch network, 
the background-subtracted FI profile along the filament’s back-
bone was averaged (Fig. 5, C and D), using pixels associated with 
the respective length calculations, where the end of the filopo-
dium is defined as μFilo (Fig. 1 A, ix). These values were then 
normalized for LifeAct expression level by dividing by the mean 
of the veil/stem intensity distribution (excluding any high-in-
tensity embedded actin bundles) calculated per frame.
The background mask used above was estimated via a coarse 
localization of the object regions in the image was first achieved 
as specified in the initial steps of the filopodia reconstruction 
(Table S1, Step VI, ii). To further ensure that none of the final

detected object was considered in the background mask, the 
veil/stem and filopodia detections, plus the forward filopodia 
search projections, were combined and the mask dilated using 
imdilate in MAT LAB. Inversion of these combined object masks 
were used to calculate the mean intensity of the background, and 
this value was subtracted from the original image. Any negative 
background-subtracted values were set to 0.
Filopodia/Branch orientation
Orientation for each filopodium is calculated as the angle between 
the filopodium’s directional vector at the site of veil/stem attach-
ment and the local direction of the veil/stem boundary . Local veil/
stem boundary vectors are defined as proceeding from the site of 
filopodia attachment, toward the neurite’s leading protrusion, in 
the direction along the veil/stem boundary . Given this definition, 
the orientation, θ, of the filopodia can assume a value between 0° 
and 180°, and for a relatively canonical GC architecture, filopodia 
with a θ value between 0° and 90° (Fig. 5 C, blue arrows) effec-
tively point toward the “front” of the neurite, whereas filopodia 
with a θ value between 90° and 180° (Fig. 5 C, orange arrows) 
effectively point toward the “back” of the neurite. Note that a filo-
podium with a θ of 0° and filopodium with a θ  of 180° are both 
considered fully collapsed onto the veil/stem, and a θ value of 90° 
indicates a filopodium positioned orthogonally (Fig. 5 C, green 
arrows) with respect to the local veil/stem. Both 0 and first-order 
segments were included in this feature distribution.
Likewise, branch filament orientations (Fig. 5 D) are defined 
as the angle between the two local vectors formed between 
branch and the root filament at the site of attachment. Root vec-
tors are defined as proceeding from the site of branch attach-
ment toward the tip of the root filament. Given these definitions, 
a branch lying along its filament stem pointing in the direction of 
the filament stem’s endpoint maintains a branch orientation, θ, 
of 0° and a branch lying along the filament stem and away from 
the filament stem’s endpoint maintains a branch orientation, θ, 
of 180°. Only second-order branch segments were included in 
this feature distribution.
Filopodia density
A filopodia/branch segment filter, as detailed in the Materials 
and methods section Design of filopodia/branch segment filters 
for feature extraction, was initially applied. However, as an ac-
curate count of filopodia is of primary importance for the den-
sity calculation, and some intensity fits for long filopodia can be 
misleadingly poor due to crossing filopodia/complex decay pro-
files, this initial filter was relaxed such that any filopodium with 
a length greater than 5 µm and a mean intensity greater than the 
50th percentile of the total distribution of segments was main-
tained for the density calculation, regardless of its correspond-
ing IFilo value. Filopodia density (Fig. 5 C) was then calculated 
by dividing the number of filtered filopodia segments directly 
attached to the veil (branch order = 0 or 1) by the total length of 
the veil/stem boundary .
Branch density and complexity
Filopodia/branch segment filtering was performed as described 
in the Filopodia density section. Second-order branch densities 
(Fig. 5 D) were calculated as the number of second-order branches 
divided by the first-order segment length. 0-order segments, 
where branch density by definition equals 0, were excluded from 
the branch density distribution, as most filopodia segments at-
tached to veil do not branch and hence, when included, these val-
ues skew the distribution toward 0. Branch complexity (Fig. 5 D) 
was defined as the total number of segments after filtering with 
a branch order greater than 1, divided by the total length of the 
complete filopodia/branch network.
GCA: Validation
Manual filopodia endpoint localization: Comparison among 
multiple annotators
Eight individual annotators were given both the image shown 
in Fig.  2  B (left) and the corresponding raw image. Using the 
“point” tool in ImageJ, they were asked to identify the endpoint 
coordinates (i.e., tip) of each filopodia/branch segment indicated 
by the 22 green dots (manually placed at the center/base of each 
filopodium). Annotators were allowed to modify the contrast of 
the raw image in ImageJ as they desired; however, they were not 
explicitly instructed to do so. The Euclidian distance between 
each filopodium endpoint annotation and the μFilo coordinate 
of GCA (Fig. 2 B, right) was calculated (Fig. 2 C). Each filopodium 
annotation was mapped to the closest point along the automated 
filopodium linescan (Fig. 2 D). Annotations mapped to linescan 
coordinates greater than μFilo (along the respective filopodium 
coordinate system) were assigned a positive value, while anno-
tations mapped to linescan coordinates less than μFilo were as-
signed a negative value (Fig. 2 C).
While in general we observed good agreement between 
GCA-detected filopodia endpoint coordinates and manual filopo-
dia endpoint annotations (Fig. 2 C), for select filopodia (Fig. 2 C, 
i and ii) we observed substantial variation among annotators, 
particularly for those filopodia exhibiting multiple FI decays 
along their length (Fig. 2 D, i and ii). In such cases, GCA auto-
mated detection often coincided well with the more subtle inten-
sity decay identified by a subset of the eight annotators. Finally , 
while the endpoint localization appeared to be underestimated in 
select cases by GCA detection as compared with manual results 
(Fig. 2 C, iii), such apparent discrepancies typically were again 
due to semantics of the filopodia endpoint definition ( Fig. 2 D, 
iii). We found these filopodia typically exhibited relatively slow 
fluorescent decay along their length and hence larger estimated 
σ values (Fig. 2 D, iii).
Further examination of the automated filopodia linescans 
marked by the manual annotator as a false positive often re-
vealed ambiguous weak signals within complex environments 
(Fig. S4 A, vi and vii). Similarly , many false-negative filopo-
dia were associated with complex intensity decays, whereby 
it became more difficult to quickly isolate an optimal fit re-
gion (Fig. S4 B).
Semi-automated validation of GCA filopodia length measurements
260 veil-attached filopodia segments from the N1E-115 dataset 
were randomly selected ( n = 88 filopodia sampled from im-
ages of unperturbed GCs and n = 14–32 filopodia sampled per 
siRNA condition). The filopodia filter was set to the defaults

used for the filopodia length feature extractions (default filter: 
ConnectToVeil_LengthInt: where filoTypes = [0,1]; filterByBun-
dleLength= [0.3,inf]; filterByFit = true; saveFiloByLengthAndSig 
= [];.embedFitCriteria = 95; filoFitCriteria = 95). Only filopodia 
segments that passed these criteria were considered in the 
random sampling.
For each sampled filopodium, the annotator was provided 
with the intensity decay along the respective filopodium and a 
zoom corresponding to the raw image and segmentation over-
lay as in Fig. S4. The annotator could refine the length of the 
filopodium by moving the detected filopodium endpoint (Fig. 
S4 A, i, iv , vi, and vii) or the base of the veil/stem (Fig. S4 A, ii 
and v) along the detected linescan and iteratively evaluating the 
updated zoomed segmentation overlays until satisfied. Low con-
fidence fits, resulting in false negatives (e.g., Fig. S4 B), were not 
included in Fig. 2 F, as these failed detections are not included in 
the final filopodia length distributions collected. An analogous 
method was used to evaluate the embedded actin bundle length 
errors in Fig. S5 D, where n = 100 embedded actin bundles were 
randomly selected from the unperturbed N1E-115 dataset. The 
semi-automatic filopodia refinement tool was custom-coded in 
MAT LAB. Data corresponding to the automated versus manually 
refined lengths were fit to a simple linear model with no inter-
cept, using fitlm in MAT LAB.
Based on this semi-automatic, curated data, we confirmed 
the accuracy of the automated length metrics for a majority of 
the filopodia sampled, even for perturbation conditions, result-
ing in complex filopodia crossings (Fig. 2 E and Fig. S4 A, iii). 
Errors in endpoint detection typically arose in cases where the 
localization of the region for the best fit along the sigmoidal was 
ambiguous due to the shape of the intensity decay profile (Fig. 
S4 A, i). Notably , while filopodia length refinements were occa-
sionally necessary due to errors in the veil/stem edge detection, 
they were often easily manually refined by using the automated 
information corresponding to the veil-embedded actin structure 
(Fig. S4, A, ii).
The complex and ambiguous intracellular decay profiles 
resulted in larger discrepancies in the automated versus man-
ually refined embedded actin bundle lengths (Fig. S5 D) as com-
pared with extra-veil filopodia detection (Fig. S4 A and Fig. S5 D, 
i, iii, and v).
Post-segmentation calculation of false-positive and 
false-negative errors
One frame for each movie in the N1E-115 dataset (66 movies total, 
excluding the acute perturbation movies of Fig. 8) was randomly 
selected. Filopodia filters were set to the defaults used for the 
filopodia density feature extraction (default filter: Connect-
ToVeil_Density: where; filoTypes = [0,1]; filterByBundleLength 
= [0.3,inf]; filterByFit = true; saveFiloByLengthAndSig = [5 inf; 
50 100];.embedFitCriteria = 95; filoFitCriteria = 95). Overlays as 
in Fig. 2 F along with the raw image were provided to the anno-
tator. The annotator was then asked to click on (1) false-positive 
and (2) false-negative filopodia in each image, and the corre-
sponding coordinates were recorded. The numbers of GCA filo-
podia detections, false positives, and false negatives were pooled 
for all images sampled for a given perturbation condition, and 
the percentages of false positives and false negatives were cal-
culated such that
 % False Positives =   # False Positives  ___________________  # GCA Detected Filopodia   × 100 
and
 % False Negatives  =   # False Negatives  ___________________________   
 # GCA Detected Filopodia−    # False Positives + # False Negatives 
   × 100. 
The post-segmentation validation tool was custom-coded  
in MAT LAB.
The above validation method confirmed a consistent false- 
positive rate 6–13% and a false-negative rate 6–16.5% for all 
perturbation images sampled. Further examination of the au-
tomated filopodia linescans marked by the manual annotator 
as a false positive often revealed ambiguous weak signal within 
complex environments (Fig. S4 A, vi and vii). Similarly , many 
false-negative filopodia were associated with complex intensity 
decays, whereby it became more difficult to quickly isolate an 
optimal fit region (Fig. S4 B).
The false-positive and false-negative error rate for the detec-
tion of the embedded actin bundles was slightly higher than for 
the traditional filopodia detections (18.1% and 17.2%; Fig. S5 A), 
as it can be more difficult to obtain robust endpoint fits that pass 
confidence criteria in the final filtering step due to the inhomoge-
neity/complexity in the intracellular intensity (Fig. S5 B). We note 
GCA is not designed to detect fully veil-embedded actin bundles 
(i.e., actin bundles without a corresponding extra-veil filopodia 
component) as part of the criteria for detection employs one-to-
one geometric matching of each filopodium to its potential em-
bedded counterpart (Fig. S5 C). Notably, many of the false-positive 
actin bundle counts were simply due to an orthogonal problem of 
incorrect veil/localization in very dense filopodia regions. How-
ever, in these cases, the automated full actin bundle length mea-
surement typically remains robust (Fig. S4 A, ii; and Fig. S5 D, iv).
Comparison of GCA to contemporary software packages
We compared the performance of GCA on our N1E-115 and in 
vivo zebrafish images to two recently released filopodia detec-
tion software packages, FiloQuant (Jacquemet et al., 2017) and 
Filopodyan (Urbančič et al., 2017; Fig. 4, A–C). Notably , in these 
packages, it was nearly impossible to establish segmentation 
parameter settings that would successfully translate to other 
frames/perturbation conditions in the same dataset (Fig.  4  B 
and Fig. S7). While the filter offered in FiloQuant (Fig. 4, A–C, iii) 
indeed appeared more sensitive than the thresholding methods 
offered in Filopodyan (Fig. 4, A–C, ii), the final threshold for this 
filter needed to be set manually in the package, making its utility 
quite limited in practice, and it was very difficult to use this en-
hanced sensitivity without introducing false positives (Fig. S7 E).
After tedious segmentation parameter optimization (Fig. 
S7, A–E), we found filopodia lengths were frequently underes-
timated in both packages (Fig.  4  B). Unlike GCA, neither con-
temporary algorithm resolves branching (Fig. 4 A) or crossing 
filopodia (Fig. 4 C), or ensures thin regions of the veil/stem are 
excluded from the filopodia detections (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore,

using these images, we show GCA is less prone to filopodia length 
underestimation due to fragmentation, crossings, and high filo-
podia density (Fig. 4 E); extracts novel features, such as veil-em-
bedded actin bundles (Fig.  4  F); and generalizes to dendritic 
filopodia (Fig. 4 G).
Statistical analysis
Correlation analysis: Unperturbed dataset
Net neurite outgrowth rate for each trajectory , as shown in 
Fig. 6 A, inset, was calculated by recording the difference between 
the neurite length (Fig. 5 A) at the start and the end of the neurite 
outgrowth trajectory . This value was then divided by the 10-min 
total time interval, for which each neurite was imaged. All other 
neurite movie features were extracted as illustrated in Fig. 5 and as 
described in the GCA: Feature extraction portion of the Materials 
and methods. Feature values were pooled for the entire neurite 
trajectory (Fig. 6 B). The mean value of each pooled distribution 
was calculated and used for the subsequent Spearman correlation 
analysis (Fig. 6, C and D). Spearman correlation coefficients and 
corresponding P values between each set of features were calcu-
lated using the corr function in MAT LAB. Benjamini and Hoch-
berg–adjusted P values were calculated using the original linear 
step-up procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) via the mafdr 
function in MAT LAB (input, “BHF DR” = true). The full distribution 
of 253 pairwise P values was used to perform the adjustments.
Hierarchical clustering of MSs
z-Score feature vectors comprising the perturbed condition MSs 
relative to control were calculated as described in Fig. 7 A. Hi-
erarchical clustering, using unweighted average linkage and a 
Euclidean distance metric, was performed via the clustergram 
function in MAT LAB.
Clustering of individual GC movies by neurite outgrowth rate
The neurite outgrowth rate in 10 min was calculated as in Figs. 5, 
6, and 7 A for n = 66 N1E-115 GC movies, including seven different 
siRNA perturbation conditions. Using these data, movies were 
separated into two groups, high and low net outgrowth, via the 
kmeans function in MAT LAB (K = 2, replicates = 20; Fig. 7 B), and 
for each cluster of movies, selected morphological features were 
directly compared between siRNA perturbation conditions and 
the control (Fig. 7 C).
Per filopodia length versus maximum curvature analysis
The length of each filopodium was calculated from its veil attach-
ment point to the filopodium endpoint (defined in this study as 
μFilo; Fig. 1 A, ix) and the maximum curvature along this length 
extracted. To reduce potential curvature/length relationships 
due to branching and/or segmentation errors, only nonbranch-
ing filopodia, connected to the veil (branch order = 0), were con-
sidered for these analyses. Spearman correlation coefficients and 
corresponding P values were calculated using the corr function 
in MAT LAB. Benjamini and Hochberg–adjusted correlation coef-
ficient P values were calculated using the original linear step-up 
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) via the mafdr func-
tion in MAT LAB (input, “BHF DR” = true). The full distribution of 
69 P values was used to perform the adjustments.
Permutation t tests: siRNA data
Each data point in Fig. 7 A, left; Fig. 7 C; and Fig. 7 E represents the 
distribution mean for the respective GCA feature value pooled 
over all frames of a single N1E-115 GC movie (5-s intervals; 10-
min duration). These values were plotted in MAT LAB using 
notBoxplot.m written by R. Campbell (https:// www .mathworks 
.com/ matlabcentral/  fileexchange/ 26508 -notboxplot), which 
plots the individual data points, the mean (bar), the 95% CIs for 
the mean (dark patch), and ±SD (light patch) for a distribution 
of values. In Fig. 7 (A, C, and E), the SD estimates the GC-to-GC 
variation for the respective GC feature calculated per GC movie. 
A two-tailed permutation t test of the means (1,900 repetitions) 
implemented in MAT LAB was performed between the control 
and each siRNA treatment distribution. The n values for Fig. 7 A 
(left) are as follows: control: 20 GC movies, 3,047–8,213 filopodia 
per movie; Cdc42: 6 GC movies, 2,872–5,607 filopodia per movie; 
RhoA: 5 GC movies, 2,743–6,298 filopodia per movie; srGAP2: 5 
GC movies, 4,052–10,216 filopodia per movie; Rac1: 9 GC movies, 
3,794–8,104 filopodia per movie; β-Pix: 9 GC movies, 2,498–6,911 
filopodia per movie; Dock7: 6 GC movies, 2,146–5,634 filopodia 
per movie; and Trio: 3 GC movies, 3,386–4,329 filopodia per 
movie. (Note the full N1E-115 dataset, corresponding code, and 
instructions on how to reproduce Fig. 7 A are included with the 
GCA software release.)
Partitioning of neurite outgrowth trajectory into velocity states
The smoothed derivative of the neurite outgrowth trajectory was 
found using the csaps function in MAT LAB where p, the smooth-
ing parameter, was set to 0.01. Each frame of the trajectory was 
labeled by its instantaneous velocity such that frames correspond-
ing to positive velocities greater than 0.5 µm/min were defined as 
growth, frames corresponding to negative velocities less than −0.5 
µm/min were labeled as retraction, and velocities between 0.5 and 
−0.5 µm/min were labeled as pausing. The growth states were fur-
ther partitioned into accelerating and decelerating by calculating 
the smoothed second derivative, again using the csaps function.
Acute drug perturbation: Permutation t tests
GCA features, filopodia length or the percent length each actin 
bundle veil embedded, were extracted using the GCA pipeline for 
each acutely treated N1E-115 GC movie (Fig. 8 B). For each movie, 
these values were pooled before and after treatment for each tra-
jectory (Fig. 8 B, ii) and plotted using the boxplot.m function in 
MAT LAB. Two-sided permutation t tests of the medians (10,000 
repetitions) were performed comparing the before and after 
treatment feature distributions for each GC movie (Fig. 8 B, ii).
Per-frame feature dimensionality reduction
The median value for each frame for each of the seven features 
noted in Fig. 8 D, i, was calculated from the GCA output. Features 
are as defined in Fig. 5 and the GCA: Feature extraction section 
of Materials and methods. For the initial time series analysis, any 
feature selection based on the correlation analysis of the time-av-
eraged data (Fig. 6) was consciously avoided to not exclude more 
subtle morphology/motility relationships that might be more 
difficult to detect via the pooled analysis. GCA features that did 
not maintain an adequate sample size per frame to be calculated

robustly (e.g., branch orientation) were not included, nor were 
features that might be considered trivially correlated (e.g., the 
correlation between full actin bundle length and filopodia length 
in Fig. 6 B partially arises due to redundancy of the two metrics). 
Note, the percentage of each actin bundle veil-embedded feature, 
as calculated in Fig. 6 (C and D), Fig. 7 A , and Fig. 8 B , yielded 
an inadequate sample size per frame, as only actin bundles with 
significant veil embedment were considered. Hence this feature 
was excluded from the multi-dimensional per-frame analysis. 
Values for each distribution of features were normalized for scale 
such that the pooled values over all experimental conditions had 
a mean of 0 and a SD of 1.
Initially principal component analysis, using the pca function 
in MAT LAB, was used to reduce the dimensionality of the seven 
features. However, the first two principal components of these 
data explained only ∼50% of the variability of the original seven 
features. Therefore, the dimensionality of the per-frame dataset 
was finally reduced to two dimensions via MDS using the MAT  
LAB mdscale function (Borg, 1997). Kruskal’s stress-1 metric (total 
error in similarity representation) was computed to be 0.026.
Time series modeling of trajectories in reduced 
morphological space
HMM selection was performed as described previously (Monnier 
et al., 2015; Gordonov et al., 2016) using the MAT LAB function 
hmm_process_cell_trajectory .m from the SAP HIRE package 
(http:// saphire -hcs .org). Specifically , 2D shape space MDS coor-
dinates for each GC movie were modeled as emissions et = (xt,yt) 
from K number of “hidden” shape states,    {   s  i      }    i=1  K   , K = {1,2,3…}. 
Therefore, for each model, Mk, the full set of parameters, θk, that 
must be inferred from the data are defined as
  θ  k   =    [    {   μ  x,i,    μ  y,i,    σ  i   }    
i=1 
  K   ,     {   π  i   }    i=1    K   ,     {   ϕ  ij   }    i,j=1    K    ]   , 
where for each shape state (bivariate Gaussian distribution), 
μi and σ i correspond to the state mean and the SD in shape 
space, respectively;    ϕ  ij      is the probability of transitioning from 
state s i to state s j within the state transition probability ma-
trix; and   π  i    is the probability of the GC starting state, si at the 
first time point.
The total marginalized likelihood of each model 
Mk is defined as
 P  (   e |    M  k     )    =    ∫       ∑  
 s  k  
     (   π   s  1          ∏  
t=2
  
T
    ϕ   s  t−1,   s  t              ∏  
t=1
  
T
    p   s  t      (   e  t   )    )   P  (    θ  k   |    M  k    )   d  θ  k  . 
Summation over the hidden state sequences was performed 
using the forward algorithm, while Metropolis Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo with importance sampling integration was used 
to calculate the total marginalized likelihood of each model and 
corresponding maximum likelihood parameters. The model 
with the highest marginalized likelihood was chosen, and the 
most likely hidden shape state sequence was calculated by the 
Viterbi algorithm using its maximum likelihood parameters. Im-
portantly , this method attempts to find the model that optimizes 
the number of morphological states based on each GC’s specific 
reduced-space morphological coordinates while penalizing in-
creasing model complexity (i.e., increasing number of states). 
The maximum number of hidden shape states, K, tested for each 
GC movie time series was set to five in this study .
Morphological states were identified for 6 acute perturba-
tion movies (for validation; Fig. 9, A and B) and 20 unperturbed 
movies (for screening; Fig. 9 D). The unperturbed GC trajec-
tory in Fig. 9 D (ii) was identified computationally by screen-
ing among all well-separated state transitions identified by 
the HMM analysis (i.e., the distance between the mean of the 
first and the second Gaussian states of the transition is larger 
than two times the SD of the first state). Specifically , all HMM- 
identified morphological transitions were screened for switches 
into a persistent morphological state (longer than 90 s), where 
the neurite outgrowth state was classified as pausing/retract-
ing for a majority of the state time points (greater than 85%), 
and accompanied by an increase in the percent time the neurite 
was pausing/retracting between the two morphology states (at 
least a 30% delta). Fig. 9 D (ii) shows the only trajectory , of the 
20 unperturbed GC movies analyzed, exhibiting a morphology 
state transition meeting the above criteria.
After HMM, each frame of a respective trajectory is assigned 
to a given HMM state. Fig. 9 (C and F)  was generated by pool-
ing scale-normalized feature data (see Materials and methods, 
Per-frame feature dimensionality reduction) associated with 
each HMM state discovered along each respective trajectory . 
Heat maps show the median corresponding to the feature value 
distribution for each respective HMM state. The kruskalwallis 
P values were calculated via the kruskalwallis function in MAT 
LAB. The resulting kruskalwallis stat structure for the filopodia 
length distributions was then input into MAT LAB’s multcompare 
function to obtain the respective Tukey–Kramer P values.
Bagplot (2D boxplot) overlays
To visualize the localization of multiple individual GC trajec-
tories within the reduced morphological MDS space and to re-
move potential outlier data points, 2D boxplots (i.e., bagplots) 
were constructed as described previously (Rousseeuw et al., 
1999) using MAT LAB code available for download at https:// 
physionet .org/ physiotools/  ecg -kit/ common/ LIB RA/ bagplot 
.m ( Goldberger et al., 2000). These plots (Fig.  8  D , iii and iv; 
Fig. 9 D, iii; and Fig. 10, A–G) are 2D versions of the more fre-
quently used one-dimensional boxplot; the inner contour, 
referred to as the “bag,” encloses 50% of the trajectory’s data 
points, while the outer contour, referred to as the “fence,” 
is the convex hull of the trajectory data points in 2D with 
outliers removed.
Separation statistic
The separation statistic, SS, in Fig. 10 H calculated between the 
control population and each respective siRNA treatment condi-
tion was formulated as an Inverse Davies–Bouldin index (Davies 
and Bouldin, 1979) such that
 SS =   ClustDist  ______________________  
   [     ∑  i=1  NPert   (  σiPert )    _ NPert   +    ∑  i=1  NCont   (  σiCont )    ___________ NCont   ]    
  . 
Here, ClustDist is the Euclidian distance between the centroid 
of the control and the centroid of the perturbation. Centroids 
of the respective populations were calculated from the pooled

perturbation (control) per-frame data points. σiPert(Cont) is 
the Euclidean distance between the centroid of the perturba -
tion (control) and the feature vector corresponding to the ith 
per-frame data point of the perturbation (control) popula-
tion. NPert(Cont) is the total number of per-frame data points 
comprising the respective pooled perturbation/control popu-
lation. Separation statistics were calculated using the full sev-
en-dimensional feature vector as defined in Fig. 8 D (i). Values 
for each distribution of features were normalized for feature 
scale such that a pooled feature distribution over all conditions 
maintained a mean of 0 and a SD of 1. CIs for each separation 
calculation were constructed via bootstrapping, i.e., each pair 
of data was randomly resampled with replacement for 10,000 
iterations maintaining the original labels. P value estimates 
were calculated by a permutation test, i.e., each pair of data 
was pooled and randomly reassigned group labels for 10,000 
iterations to estimate the null distribution.

complementing Fig. 1. Fig. S3 details how GCA formulates the 
filopodia/branch reconstruction as a graph matching problem. 
Fig. S4 plots the GCA automated linescans corresponding to 
select veil/stem filopodia from Fig. 2 E as well as a false-nega-
tive filopodia resulting from a poor sigmoidal fit. Fig. S5 shows 
the results from the semi-automated validation of GCA ’s em-
bedded actin bundle detection and corresponding length mea-
surements. Fig. S6 shows GCA segmentation and veil velocity 
analysis applied to previously published, primary mouse and 
differentiated induced pluripotent stem cell motor neurons. Fig. 
S7 shows how the segmentation parameters in Fig. 4 (A and B) 
for previously published software Filopodyan (Urbančič et al., 
2017; ii) and FiloQuant (Jacquemet et al., 2017; iii) were chosen 
using systematic segmentation parameter scanning. Videos 1, 
2, and 3 show steps in the segmentation algorithm for a canon-
ical unperturbed GC (Video 1), several noncanonical GC veil/
stems (Video  2), and two noncanonical GC filopodia/branch 
reconstructions (Video 3), respectively . Videos 4, 5, and 6 show 
GCA filopodia segmentation and local veil velocity overlays for 
example control (Video 4), Rho GTPase siRNA (Video 5), or select 
Rac1 GEF/GAP siRNA (Video 6)–treated N1E-115 GCs labeled with 
GFP LifeAct. Videos 7 and 8 compile movies of GCA filopodia seg-
mentation and either veil/stem thickness (Video 7) or local veil 
velocity (Video 8) for GCs of varying size, type, and fluorescent 
label, imaged in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Videos 9 and 10 show 
dynamic visualizations of how a GC morphology changes over 
time in reduced morphology space for an N1E-115 GC acutely 
treated with DMSO (Video 9) or 25 µM CK666 (Video 10). Data 
points in Videos 9 and 10 are colored by instantaneous neurite 
outgrowth (top; Fig. 8 E) or HMM morphology state (bottom; 
Fig. 9 A) classification. Table S1 lists GCA segmentation param-
eters, default settings, and recommendations. Table S2 provides 
the siRNA sequences used in this study .
