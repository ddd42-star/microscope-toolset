Cancer cell migration enables metastatic spread causing most cancer deaths. Rho-family GTPases control cell migration, but being em-
bedded in a highly interconnected feedback network, the control of their dynamical behavior during cell migration remains elusive. To
address this question, we reconstructed the Rho-family GTPases signaling network involved in cell migration, and developed a Boolean
network model to analyze the different states and emergent rewiring of the Rho-family GTPases signaling network at protrusions and
during extracellular matrix-dependent cell migration. Extensive simulations and experimental validations revealed that the bursts of
RhoA activity induced at protrusions by EGF are regulated by a negative-feedback module composed of Src, FAK, and CSK. Interestingly,
perturbing this module interfered with cyclic Rho activation and extracellular matrix-dependent migration, suggesting that CSK inhib-
ition can be a novel and effective intervention strategy for blocking extracellular matrix-dependent cancer cell migration, while Src in-
hibition might fail, depending on the genetic background of cells. Thus, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms that
regulate the intricate activation states of Rho-family GTPases during extracellular matrix-dependent migration, revealing potential
new targets for interfering with extracellular matrix-dependent cancer cell migration.

Introduction
Cell migration is a complex process controlled by various extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) and cellular determinants that are cell-type
dependent (Friedl and Wolf,2010). For some cell types such as leu-
kocytes, migration is essential for their immune-defensive func-
tion, and hence maintained throughout their life span ( Friedl and
Wolf, 2010). For most cell types, however, migration is strictly con-
ﬁned to morphogenesis during development except for tissue
regeneration or neoplasia ( Friedl and Wolf, 2010). Cancer cells
often escape from this strict regulation of migration and metasta-
size to form secondary tumors away from the primary tumor,
causing most cancer deaths (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; Croft
and Olson, 2008).
Several lines of evidence have highlighted the pivotal role of
Rho-family GTPases that work together to control cytoskeleton
dynamics in the process of cell migration ( Sahai and Marshall,
2002; Machacek et al., 2009). Members of the Rho-family, which
include RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are critical for cell migration, and
their activities need to be tightly coordinated in order to allow
cells to move (Heasman and Ridley,2008). RhoA has been involved
in regulating both leading edge membrane protrusion (Pertz et al.,
2006; Machacek et al., 2009) and the contractile force for moving
the body and tail of the cell ( Sahai and Marshall, 2002). Rac 1
induces the assembly of actin-rich lamellipodia at the leading edge
of the cell. Cdc42 is thought to be involved in establishing the direc-
tionality of movement by forming actin-rich spikes (ﬁlopodia) that
can sense chemotactic signals ( Sahai and Marshall, 2002).
Consistently, studies with FRET-based biosensors have shown that
all three GTPases are activated at the leading edge ( Machacek
et al.,2009), while RhoA activity has also been observed at the trail-
ing edge (Pertz et al., 2006). Furthermore, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42
can mutually regulate each other’s activities (Sander et al., 1999;
Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004; Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008;
Machacek et al.,2009; Friedl and Wolf,2010; Tsyganov et al.,2012).

A number of reports indicate that the coordinated cyclic iteration
of leading edge protrusion and subsequent rear end retraction is
required for cell movement (Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996;
Lammermann and Sixt, 2009; Friedl and Wolf, 2010). Moreover, it
has been suggested that the occurrence of high RhoA and Rac
activities at the leading edge is likely cyclic, thereby providing a
necessary push-pull mechanism for cell migration ( Tomar and
Schlaepfer, 2009). Another layer of regulation is the interface
between the forces that regulate actin polymerization and depoly-
merization at protrusions and the signal transduction events that
stimulate cell migration. Recent results suggest that actin polymer-
ization and depolymerization occur in cycles and that signaling
events impinge on these cycles and stabilize protrusions to
enable migration (Huang et al., 2013).
Many reports showing their aberrant regulation in various tumor
types suggest the Rho-family GTPases as putative therapeutic
targets for inhibiting metastasis ( Sahai and Marshall, 2002).
However, accumulating evidence indicates that they are embedded
in a highly interconnected feedback network that intricately regu-
lates their activities (Figure 1A). Thus, the mechanisms by which
Rho-family GTPases are regulated and especially how their activ-
ities are coordinated to promote cell migration are still poorly
understood. This raises intriguing questions: (i) what determines
the cyclic behavior of Rho-family GTPases at the leading edge
that enables cell migration; and (ii) which component should be tar-
geted in the context of a complex signaling network to effectively
block the cancer cell migration?
Here, we investigated these questions by using a dynamic
Boolean network model combined with experimental validations
using two isogenic human ovarian cancer cell lines that differ in
their extracellular matrix-dependent migratory capacity. We
found that cyclical bursts of RhoA activity are induced during cell
migration, and that the negative feedbacks interconnecting Src,
FAK, and/or CSK are critical for driving the cyclical RhoA activity.
Disruption of the critical negative feedbacks by inhibiting CSK
strongly suppressed cyclical bursts of RhoA activity and motility,
implying that targeting these feedbacks is an effective strategy
for interfering with cancer cell migration. Our ﬁndings also high-
light the signiﬁcance of network-level analyses for understanding
complex bio-molecular regulatory mechanisms.
Results
Strategy for the reconstruction of the Rho-family GTPases signaling
network model
Our aim was to understand how the activity of Rho-family
GTPases is regulated at cell protrusions and correlate the biochem-
ical events with extracellular matrix-dependent migration as bio-
logical network output. For this purpose, we ﬁrst reconstructed a
generic Rho-family GTPases signaling network by integrating all
relevant information of individual key proteins, which we identiﬁed
in the respective cell lines by mass spectrometry, and their
interactions through an extensive survey of the literature (see
Supplementary Materials and methods). This network includes sig-
naling nodes from the Ras-ERK/PI3K cascade, as well as adhesion
components operating downstream of the EGF receptor. A further
layer of signaling nodes involves GEFs and GAPs that ultimately
control the activity of the three canonical Rho GTPases: RhoA,
Rac1, and Cdc 42. This initial network is generic and does not
include localization-speciﬁc spatial information. In order to
derive a network that reﬂects Rho activation at leading edge protru-
sions, we (i) calibrated this network with experimental data meas-
uring RhoA activity at protrusions, and (ii) reﬁned the network
topology that correctly simulates the experimentally observed
RhoA activities through systematically eliminating network con-
nections. This strategy allowed us to derive a network that accur-
ately described changes in RhoA activity states at protrusions
and could be used to analyze the signaling nodes that control
these activities. Although not explicitly measured in a spatially
resolved manner, the network also allows making predictions of
the activities of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases.
Due to the generally very limited information on the kinetics of
each biochemical interaction, continuous, differential equation-
based models that model each biochemical reaction are difﬁcult
to parameterize realistically for large complex networks ( Helikar
et al., 2008). To avoid this problem, parameter-free discrete logic-
based models have been applied to explore generic properties of
complex bio-molecular regulatory networks ( Gupta et al., 2007;
Helikar et al., 2008; Kwon and Cho, 2008a, b; Saez-Rodriguez
et al., 2009). Although these models simplify the kinetics of bio-
chemical reaction to on-off relationships, they are still very useful
to model global network states and assess dynamic changes as
methods). Only two attractors were observed in all the cases, labeled1 and 2. Only the states of the Rho-family GTPases (i.e. RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42)
in each attractor are shown for simplicity (see Supplementary Table S5 for all the states in the network for each attractor). The ‘basin size’ refers to
the relative size of ‘basin of attraction’ given in percentage for each attractor. The ‘Normal’, ‘A2780’, and ‘A2780-Rab25’ denote ‘intact mutation-
free’, ‘inactive PTEN mutation’, and ‘inactive PTEN and active integrins mutation’ conditions, respectively. (C) Sample activity maps (bottom panel)

(windows 20–35) and A2780-Rab25 (windows 15–25) cells. (D) EGF stimulation increases the average number of RhoA activity bursts in both

al replicates and at least 50 tracked cells per condition). A random sample of cell migration patterns, illustrated in form of stars, shows how EGF
stimulation affects migration speed in comparison with starved condition (data from A2780 random cell migration). (F) Rac1 and Cdc42 activities

transitions between these states. Therefore, we developed a dis-
crete Boolean model based on the mechanistic information about
the activation and/or inhibition of each signaling protein (see
Supplementary Materials and methods and Table S 4). In the
Boolean network model, the state value of each node represents
its activity, and is discretely represented as either ‘0’ for an inactive
or ‘1’ for an active state.
The resulting generic literature-based signaling network
consists of 33 nodes and 83 directed links (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Table S2). This network contains an external-input
node epidermal growth factor (EGF), which provides a potent extra-
cellular cue for migration, and three output nodes for the best
characterized Rho-family GTPases, i.e. RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42. The
generic network is highly interconnected with at least 121 (62
negative and 59 positive) feedback loops such that any two
nodes in the network are connected to each other, except for the
external-input node EGF (see Supplementary Materials and
methods and Table S3).
For the experimental validations, we used a well-established cel-
lular model of extracellular matrix-dependent migration consisting
of the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780, which has a loss-
of-function mutation of PTEN, and its derivative A 2780-Rab25,
which overexpresses Rab 25 (Cheng et al., 2004; Caswell et al.,
2007). Rab25 has been linked to tumor progression, aggression,
and metastasis, both clinically and in mouse models ( Cheng
et al., 2004). Rab25 enhances extracellular matrix-dependent mi-
gration by delivering integrins to the plasma membrane at protru-
sions and increasing migration persistence (Caswell et al., 2007).
This increases the ability of cancer cells to invade the extracellular
matrix. Hence, in our computational model, the cellular contexts
of A2780 and A2780-Rab25 are represented by introducing consti-
tutively inactive PTEN without and with constitutively active integ-
rins, respectively. Interestingly, when these cells are plated on
plastic, i.e. without integrin engagement, Rab 25 overexpression
does not alter cell morphology or cell migratory characteristics,
such as velocity, persistence, directionality, and formation of pro-
trusions. On the other hand, when plated on a cell-derived matrix
(CDM), a pseudo-3D environment produced by ﬁbroblasts, Rab25
overexpression changes cell morphology and promotes extracellu-
lar matrix-dependent migration ( Cukierman et al., 2001; Caswell
et al., 2007). In order to keep the coherence of our computational
modeling and experimental validation, we also used EGF as an ex-
ternal input in both cell lines. As we were speciﬁcally interested in
extracellular matrix-dependent migration, we characterized and ex-
perimentally measured this by the combination of random cell mi-
gration speed and persistence using cells plated on CDM under
EGF-free and EGF stimulation conditions, making our results par-
ticularly relevant for EGF-induced and CDM-dependent migration.
Analysis of the generic Rho GTPase signaling network
The behavior of a complex cellular regulatory network can be ef-
fectively analyzed in a state-space where each point represents one
network state deﬁned by ‘a set of state values containing the activ-
ity states of all signaling nodes in the network’ (Huang et al.,2005;
Bhattacharya et al.,2011; Ding and Wang,2011; Choi et al.,2012).
The network dynamics can be viewed in terms of a ﬂow in the state-
space that connects transition trajectories among all possible
network states (Helikar and Rogers,2009). Although protein activ-
ities are dynamically regulated by interactions among many signal-
ing proteins in the network, they will eventually reach certain
characteristic stable states called ‘attractors’ (Choi et al., 2012).
Depending on whether the attractor consists of a single network
state or a set of network states forming a cycle, it is classiﬁed as
a point attractor or a cyclic attractor. The region of network states
around a particular attractor with trajectories converging toward
the attractor is called the ‘basin of attraction’ (Huang et al., 2005).
We applied this state-space approach to our generic Rho-family
GTPases signaling network, in which an attractor represents a
stable state of protein activities. The attractors are identiﬁed
from Boolean simulations using randomly sampled initial condi-
tions or network states (see Supplementary Materials and
methods). Although various attractors can be present in the
state-space, cellular behavior is often governed by the dominant
stable state known as a ‘primary attractor’ with the largest basin
of attraction ( Li et al., 2004). We simulated the behavior of
Rho-family GTPases in three network contexts, (i) a normal,
mutation-free network, (ii) a PTEN-mutated network reﬂecting
the A2780 cells, and (iii) a network with PTEN mutation and acti-
vated integrins representing the A 2780-Rab25 cells. Under
EGF-free conditions, the majority of network states eventually
converged into primary point attractors where all the Rho-family
GTPases were inactive (left panel in Figure1B and top panel in
Supplementary Figure S 1). When EGF stimulation was applied,
cyclic attractors appeared (right panel in Figure 1B and bottom
panel in Supplementary Figure S 1), i.e. the network converged
on recursive cycling between network states. Speciﬁcally, RhoA
and Rac were cyclically activated in both primary and secondary
attractors for all three cellular contexts. In contrast, Cdc 42 was
cyclically activated only in the normal and A 2780 contexts, but
was persistently activated in the A 2780-Rab25 context.
In accordance with our simulation results, bursts of RhoA activity
at leading edge protrusions were induced by EGF in both A2780 and
A2780-Rab25 cells as determined by FRET biosensor experiments
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Videos S1 and S2). EGF also increased
the average number of RhoA activity bursts (Figure 1D), and aug-
mented the speed of migration on CDM in both A 2780 cell lines
(left panel in Figure 1E). However, EGF enhanced the persistence
of migration only in A 2780-Rab25 cells (right panel in Figure 1E).
This property has previously been associated with a more invasive
behavior of A2780-Rab25 cells compared with A2780 cells (Caswell
et al., 2007). Rac and Cdc 42 activity, determined by pulldown
assays, was low in untreated cells, and inducible by EGF to
similar extents in both cell lines (Figure 1F). Currently, Rac and
Cdc42 FRET biosensors, which are GDI-regulated, are not robust
enough to measure spatially resolved kinetics of Rac and Cdc42 ac-
tivities on CDM in the number of living cells needed for statistically
signiﬁcant measurements. Thus, these experimental results show
that all three Rho-family GTPases are activated by EGF, and that
consistent with the model predictions, bursts of RhoA activity are
induced by EGF in both cell lines (Figure 1B).
Signaling-feedback modules that control cell migration | 245

Identiﬁcation of a critical signaling-feedback module that drives
RhoA activity bursts at protrusions by network pruning
Having identiﬁed cyclical RhoA activation dynamics in computa-
tional simulations that might represent experimentally measured
bursts of RhoA activity poses the question of the network-encoding
source of such activities. Negative feedbacks have been shown
to be capable of generating oscillations or cyclical behavior in
many biological systems depending on the cellular context
(Kholodenko, 2000; Wolkenhauer et al., 2004; Kwon and Cho,
2007; Goh et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2008). It is important to note
that our modeling strategy represents an abstraction that does
not account for exact quantitative features, such as amplitude or
oscillation frequencies, but can identify general regulatory roles
of such feedback modules arising from the context of the
network topology. Thus, the purpose of our model is to enable the
network-based discovery of signaling modules that regulate
Rho-family GTPases. The Rho-family GTPases signaling network
comprises many negative feedbacks (Supplementary Table S3). In
order to systematically identify critical negative feedbacks that
drive the cyclical RhoA/Rac activities in the model (Figure 1B), we
in silicodeleted each link testing how effectively cyclical RhoA/Rac
activities were suppressed by removal of a particular link under
persistent EGF stimulation (Figure 2A). As RhoA activities were
experimentally measured at protrusions, thisin silicolink deletion
analysis effectively identiﬁed which links are relevant for controlling
RhoA behavior at leading edge protrusions, enabling us to recon-
struct the topology of the signaling network that controls RhoA acti-
vation at the leading edge. Foreach link deletion, the effectiveness of
perturbation was measured by the remaining percentage of cases
with cyclical activities in either RhoA or Rac for all initial network
states (see Supplementary Materials and methods). The link dele-
tions that disrupted cyclical RhoA/Rac activities .1%a r es h o w n
in Figure 2A (see the ﬁgure legend for details). This analysis identi-
ﬁed the negative-feedback modules in the network, which are
perturbed by these link deletions, revealing a dynamic rewiring
between the normal, A 2780, and A 2780-Rab25 networks (see
Supplementary Materials and methods, Figure2B–D).
More importantly, the link deletion analysis also identiﬁed core
modules, which entertain cyclical activities in different cellular con-
texts. We found that ‘CSK inhibiting (– |) Src’, ‘Src activating (/shortrightarrow )
CSK’, ‘FAK/shortrightarrow CSK’, and ‘EGF/shortrightarrow EGFR’ links are critical for cyclical
RhoA/Rac activities, since deletion of either link severely
reduced (i.e. ,50%) the cyclical activities of both RhoA and Rac
in all cellular contexts (Figure 2A). The ‘EGF /shortrightarrow EGFR’ link is
required for RhoA /Rac activation. The remaining critical links
form a negative-feedback module, which includes two negative
feedbacks composed of Src, FAK, and/or CSK that can generate cyc-
lical activities: ‘Src /shortrightarrow CSK – | Src’ and ‘Src/shortrightarrow FAK /shortrightarrow CSK – | Src’
(Figure 2E). As this is the only critical negative-feedback module
that is common to all cellular contexts (indicated by dashed lines
in Figure 2B–D), we suggest that the negative-feedback module
composed of Src/FAK/CSK is an essential driver of cyclical RhoA/
Rac activities in the pruned (i.e. protrusion-speciﬁc) model, and
that disruption of this module might interfere with migration in
all cellular contexts.
Notably, the effectiveness of perturbations for the common Src/
FAK/CSK negative-feedback module was different depending
on the cellular context: complete suppression of cyclical RhoA /
Rac activities was only observed in the A 2780-Rab25 context
(Figure 2A). For the normal and A 2780 contexts, there is
another critical negative-feedback module consisting of ‘EGFR/shortrightarrow
PTP_EGFR – | EGFR’ (indicated by dotted lines in Figure2B and C).
Disruption of this feedback module resulted in the complete sup-
pression of cyclical RhoA/Rac activities in the normal cellular
context (Figure 2A), suggesting its dominance over Src /FAK/CSK
module for cyclical RhoA/Rac activities. In the A2780 context, dis-
ruption of neither EGFR /PTP_EGFR nor Src /FAK/CSK module
resulted in a complete suppression of cyclical RhoA/Rac activities.
However, cyclical RhoA /Rac activities were entirely abolished by
any combinatorial link deletion that disrupted both negative-
feedback modules (Supplementary Figure S 2), suggesting that
they cooperate to generate cyclical activities for RhoA and Rac in
the A2780 context. Therefore, the model predicts that essential
negative-feedback modules required for cyclical RhoA /Rac activ-
ities might change as the cellular context changes, with normal
cells requiring the EGFR/PTP_EGFR module, A2780-Rab25 requir-
ing the Src /FAK/CSK module, and A 2780 as an intermediate
using both modules (Figure 2F).
Designing model-based intervention strategies for interfering
with extracellular matrix-dependent cell migration
A major goal of the model analysis was to identify mechanisms
for blocking extracellular matrix-dependent cell migration.
Therefore, we systematically investigated strategies for disrupting
the cyclical activities generated by the aforementioned negative-
feedback modules. To this end, we performed in silico node
control analysis under persistent EGF stimulus by pinning the
state of each node to either ‘0’ for complete inhibition or ‘1’ for con-
stitutive activation. The effectiveness of the node control was mea-
sured in the same manner as in the link deletion analysis, i.e. by
determining the remaining percentage of cases with cyclical activ-
ities in either RhoA or Rac (see Supplementary Materials and
methods). Only the results that disrupted cyclical activities are
shown in Figure 3A.
Interestingly, the results of the node control analysis conﬁrmed
the signiﬁcance of the Src/FAK/CSK and EGFR/PTP_EGFR negative-
feedback modules in regulating RhoA and Rac activities. Persistent
inhibition of CSK or activation of Src or FAK induced sustained RhoA
activation and Rac inhibition leading to a severe suppression (i.e.
,40%; Figure 3A) of cyclical RhoA and Rac activities in all cellular
contexts (Figure3B). On the contrary, persistent inhibition of Src or
FAK or activation of CSK was effective only in the A 2780-Rab25
context, while RhoA and Rac were still cyclically activated in the
normal and A 2780 contexts (Figure 3B). Any perturbation of Src
or CSK suppressed the cyclical activity of the Src /FAK/CSK
module itself in the primary attractors of all cellular contexts.
What causes this differential effect of the Src /FAK/CSK module
on the regulation of cyclical RhoA /Rac activities? For Src ¼0 and
CSK¼1, the cyclical signal generated by the EGFR /PTP_EGFR
module is still transmitted to downstream effectors through PI 3K

Figure 2 Identiﬁcation of a critical negative-feedback module that regulates cyclical RhoA/Rac activities. (A) Link deletion analysis to identity links
that interrupt cyclical activities in both RhoA and Rac. After deletion of each link, Boolean simulations were performed under persistent EGF. The
effectiveness of each link deletion is represented by the remaining percentage of cases with cyclical activities in either RhoA or Rac from all100000
cases of initial network states, when compared with 100% for the perturbation-free condition. Only the effective links (i.e. disruption of which
resulted in ,99% remaining cases with cyclical activities in either RhoA or Rac) are shown. The links ‘CSK – | Src’, ‘Src/shortrightarrow CSK’, ‘FAK/shortrightarrow CSK’,
and ‘EGF/shortrightarrow EGFR’ are critical for cyclical RhoA/Rac activities, since disruption of either results in strong inhibition (i.e. ,50%) of both RhoA
and Rac cyclical activities in all cellular contexts. ( B–D) Negative-feedback network composed of the negative feedbacks that include at least
one effective link for normal ( B), A2780 (C), and A 2780-Rab25 (D) contexts under persistent EGF stimulation. The critical negative-feedback
module composed of Src, FAK, and CSK (encircled by a dashed line) is common to all cellular contexts under persistent EGF stimulation.
Another negative-feedback module consisting of EGFR and PTP_EGFR (encircled by a dotted line) is also required for cyclical RhoA/Rac activities
in the normal and A2780 contexts. The effective links shown inA are highlighted by thick lines, and the effective links that are not part of the cor-
responding effective negative-feedback network are colored black. Asterisks denote the essential links that result in a complete disruption of cyc-
lical RhoA/Rac activities as shown inA. The color of each node represents its state in the primary attractor for each cellular context (i.e. green for0 ¼
off, yellow for cyclical activity, and red for1 ¼ on). (E) The critical negative-feedback module is composed of Src, FAK, and CSK. It contains three
common effective links: ‘CSK –| Src’, ‘Src/shortrightarrow CSK’, and ‘FAK/shortrightarrow CSK’. Two negative feedbacks are embedded in this module: ‘Src/shortrightarrow CSK – | Src’
and ‘Src/shortrightarrow FAK /shortrightarrow CSK – | Src’. Functionally, the two feedbacks are equivalent to a single system that incorporates both feedbacks. ( F) The

in the normal and A 2780 contexts, whereas Src ¼1 and CSK ¼0
conditions nullify the transfer of a cyclical signal by causing persist-
ent PI3K activity (Supplementary Figure S3). In fact, the combined
inhibition of Src with PI3K resulted in the complete suppression of
RhoA/Rac cyclical activities in all cellular contexts (Supplementary
Figure S 4). Both EGFR ¼0 and PTP_EGFR ¼1 result in the EGFR
being unresponsive to EGF, causing an effect similar to the deletion
of the ‘EGF/shortrightarrow EGFR’ link. In contrast, EGFR¼1 and PTP_EGFR¼0 are
similar to disrupting the EGFR/PTP_EGFR negative-feedback module
by deletion of either ‘EGFR/shortrightarrow PTP_EGFR’ or ‘PTP_EGFR –| EGFR’ link
(Figures2Aa n d3A).
It is very reasonable to assume that a disruption of cyclical RhoA/
Rac activities will stall the leading edge and consequently also fore-
stall cell migration. In this respect, our modeling results suggested
that EGF-induced and CDM-dependent migration might be effect-
ively blocked by CSK inhibition through the disruption of both
RhoA and Rac cyclical activities in all cellular contexts, whereas
Src or FAK inhibition should be effective only in the A2780-Rab25
context (Figure 3B). In order to validate this simulation-derived hy-
pothesis, a speciﬁc Src-family kinase inhibitor (PP2) and CSK siRNA
were used for perturbing the system. Currently, FAK small-molecule
inhibitors are less speciﬁc. Therefore, we did not include them in
our validation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the Src inhibitor
disrupted cyclical bursts of RhoA activity (top panel in Figure3C,
Supplementary Videos S 1 and S 2), decreased the average
number of RhoA activity bursts (Figure3D), and impeded the migra-
tion speed (Figure 3E) only in A 2780-Rab25 cells. On the other
hand, knocking down CSK was inhibitory to all these outputs
in both cell lines (Figure 3D, bottom panel in Figure 3C,
Supplementary Videos S1 and S2). Both migration speed and per-
sistence were decreased by CSK knockdown in A2780-Rab25 cells,
indicating reduced overall migration, but only a severe reduction in
migration speed was observed in A2780cells without any change in
persistence, leading to the decrease in the overall migration
(Figure3E). Moreover, although the Src inhibitor failed to impede
the migration speed in A 2780 cells, the combinatorial inhibition
of Src and PI3K (one of the direct effectors of EGFR) synergistically
reduced the migration speed and persistence further and even
below those of starved cells (Figure 3F). Notably, either Src or
CSK inhibition reverted the increased migration persistence by
EGF in A2780-Rab25 cells back to the level seen in starved cells
(Figure 3E). These results show that Src and surprisingly also CSK
inhibition can interfere with cell migration. Src inhibition blocks
cyclical RhoA activity and migration in the A2780-Rab25 cells,
where EGF-induced and CDM-dependent migration is enabled by
enhanced integrin delivery to the cell membrane ( Caswell et al.,
2007), but is ineffective in A2780 cells where migration is promoted
by PTEN mutation (Wu et al., 2008). On the other hand, CSK inhib-
ition could interfere with cyclical RhoA activation and cell migration
in both A2780 and A2780-Rab25 cells, suggesting that the effects
of Src inhibition on cancer cell migration are more context-
dependent than the effects of CSK.
Discussion
In summary, our data suggest that when cells are stimulated to
migrate by application of EGF, the negative-feedback modules
Src/FAK/CSK and /or EGFR /PTP_EGFR generate the signals that
drive the cyclical RhoA/Rac activities, which are required for cell mi-
gration (Figure 4A and B). The cyclical RhoA /Rac activities have
been suggested to coordinate the cycles of membrane protrusion
and retraction that enable cells to migrate (Machacek et al.,
2009). It was experimentally found that the global motile behavior
of podosome-like structure (PLS) zones results from the cycles of
single PLS appearance/disappearance (Martin et al., 2014). The
formation of a PLS zone was dynamically correlated with low
RhoA and myosin activity at the leading edge ( Martin et al.,
2014). In addition, the motility of the cells expressing constitutively
active RhoA mutant (RhoA-V14) was dramatically reduced, consist-
ent with the hypothesis that high RhoA activity suppresses motility
by preventing Rac-induced protrusions (Vial et al.,2003). Increased
RhoA activity might be the cause of increased stress ﬁber formation
and focal adhesions, which in turn inhibits protrusions, polarized
phenotype, and cell motility (Vial et al., 2003). Together, these
suggest that cyclical bursts of RhoA activity are needed at the pro-
trusion site for cell migration. The cyclic RhoA activity, which in turn
negatively feeds back to FAK through PTEN (Figure1A), might con-
tribute to the oscillatory FAK and Src activity, causing an iterative
adhesion assembly and disassembly, and providing a necessary
push-pull mechanism for the cells to move forward.
Any interruption of the cyclical activities of the Rho-family
GTPases, such as the CSK inhibition as presented in this study,
might lead to an effective therapeutic strategy for interfering
cancer cell migration. This result may seem counterintuitive, as
Src has been shown to stimulate cell migration and invasiveness
(Guarino, 2010), and CSK inhibits Src ( Ia et al., 2010). However,
as the modeling and experimental work shows, the salient principle
of inhibiting migration is to break the cyclically bursting activities of
RhoA, and also possibly Rac as shown from simulations. Thus, tar-
geting speciﬁc dynamic properties of signal transduction networks
rather than a node itself may constitute a promising principle that
expands the space of potential drug targets. From this point of view,
it is plausible that inhibition of either Src or CSK can block migra-
tion. Previous work showed that downregulation of CSK can acti-
vate Src and enhance cell migration ( Vidal and Cagan, 2006;
Liang et al., 2007). These results are not necessarily in conﬂict
with ours, as we show that the effects of Src or CSK inhibition are
dependent on the cell context. Alternatively, these discrepancies
may be due to the use of different model systems, i.e. Drosophila
usage of essential feedback modules shifts depending on cellular contexts. The critical negative-feedback module interconnecting Src, FAK, and
CSK is essential in the A2780-Rab25 context, since any link disruption results in complete suppression of cyclical RhoA/Rac activities. On the other
hand, only the EGFR /PTP_EGFR negative-feedback module is essential in the normal cellular context, whereas disruption of both modules is
required for entire suppression of cyclical RhoA/Rac activities in A2780 context.

Figure 3 Designing interventions that block extracellular matrix-dependent cell migration. (A) Node control analysis for the effective disruption of
cyclical RhoA/Rac activities. Each node was pinned to either ‘0’o r‘1’ before Boolean simulations were performed under persistent EGF stimulation.
The effectiveness of perturbation is measured in the same way as in the link deletion analysis. The persistent inhibition of CSK or activation of Src or
FAK results in the strong suppression (i.e.,40%) of both RhoA and Rac cyclical activities in all cellular contexts. In contrast, the persistent inhib-
ition of Src or FAK or activation of CSK is effective only in A2780-Rab25.( B) Contrasting node control effects for the complete inhibition or consti-
tutive activation of Src, FAK, or CSK. Although persistent inhibition of Src also suppresses FAK and CSK, the cyclical RhoA/Rac activities still remain
undisrupted in the normal and A2780 contexts. (C) Sample activity maps (second and fourth rows) of RhoA, alongside with respective sampling

(Vidal and Cagan, 2006), or different assays for cell migration
(Liang et al., 2007).
Interestingly, perturbations within the Src /FAK/CSK negative-
feedback module showed different effects depending on the
genetic background of the cells. Inhibition of Src blocked cyclical
bursts of RhoA activity and migration only in the EGF-induced and
CDM-dependent migratory (A 2780-Rab25) cells, whereas CSK
downregulation efﬁciently inhibited both processes in the EGF-
induced and CDM-dependent migratory and parental (A 2780)
cancer cells. Importantly, these results suggest that CSK inhibition
can prevent cancer cells from becoming migratory and invasive,
while Src inhibition can only block migration of cancer cells
that already have acquired an EGF-induced and CDM-
dependent migratory phenotype.
For metastasis, cancer cells need to acquire both motility and
invasive capacity. As supported by the enhanced migration per-
sistence of A2780-Rab25 cells by EGF (right panel in Figure 1E)
and the persistently active Cdc 42 in our simulations (right
bottom panel in Figure 1B), the migration persistence might
affect the invasiveness of migrating cells (Figure 4B) by potentiat-
ing the directionality of movement possibly through Cdc 42
(Sahai and Marshall, 2002). Hence, our Rho-family GTPases
signaling network model may further be extended and utilized
to investigate the invasive capacity conferred to cancer cells by
Rac and Cdc42. Intriguingly, tumor cells may switch between mu-
tually exclusive modes of invasion, depending on the microenvir-
onment they encounter as they move away from the primary
tumor: (i) a Rac-dependent, mesenchymal type of invasion with
elongated morphology, and (ii) a RhoA-dependent, amoeboid
type of invasion with rounded morphology ( Croft and Olson,
2008). Furthermore, it will be also interesting to integrate the
migration model with other cellular functions of the Rho-family
GTPases, such as cell polarization and cell cycle regulation
(Sahai and Marshall, 2002), for the study of overall coordination
between cell movement and cell proliferation that contribute to
metastatic tumor growth.
Cells are composed of numerous molecular components that
are interacting with each other and form a complex molecular inter-
action network. Therefore, to have a proper understanding of the
functional role of each molecular component, we need to investi-
gate the regulatory relationship of the component within the
context of the whole interaction network. Recent technological
developments opened up various ‘omics’ studies, leading to a
paradigm shift in disease diagnosis and treatment ( Marko and
Weil, 2010; Barretina et al., 2012; Hoadley et al., 2014).
Molecular sub-typing of colorectal cancer for more effective treat-
ment is one of the examples (De Sousa et al., 2013; Sadanandam
et al., 2013). However, even if we can identify drug targets
windows (ﬁrst and third rows) from similar regions of cells in different conditions. Scale bar,5 mm. The color bar indicates the activation level of
RhoA. While Src inhibition has no effect on the cyclical bursts of RhoA activity in A2780 (windows 25–35 for EGF and 10–20 for Src inhibition), it
disrupts the cyclical bursts of RhoA activity induced by EGF stimulation (windows10–25) only in A2780-Rab25 cells (no visible activity bursts). CSK
knockdown disrupts the cyclical bursts of RhoA activity induced by EGF stimulation (windows1–15 for A2780 and 5–20 for A2780-Rab25) in both
cell lines (no visible activity bursts). (D) The differential effect of Src inhibition and CSK knockdown on the average number of RhoA activity bursts,
induced by EGF stimulation (refer to Figure 1D)i nA 2780 and A2780-Rab25 cells. Src inhibition decreases the average number of RhoA activity
bursts only in A 2780-Rab25 cells, whereas CSK knockdown decreases the average number of RhoA activity bursts in both A 2780 and
A2780-Rab25 cells. (E) The differential effects of Src inhibition (left two panels) and CSK knockdown (right two panels) on the migratory character-
istics of A2780 and A2780-Rab25 cells. Average speed and migration persistence ratios are calculated by normalizing the respective values to their
EGF-treated counterparts. Src inhibition decreases both average migration speed and persistence only in A 2780-Rab25 cells. CSK knockdown
decreases average migration speeds in both A 2780 and A 2780-Rab25 cells, although it only decreases the migration persistence of
A2780-Rab25 cells. (F) Migratory behavior of A 2780 cells in response to combined inhibition of Src and PI 3K. Combined inhibition of Src and
PI3K (using PP 2 and/or LY 294002 at 10 mM) synergistically reduces the migration speed of A 2780 cells. The epistasis index is calculated
based on the non-scaled epistasis deﬁnition ( Segre et al., 2005) by normalizing all values to EGF values and predicting the additive effect of
the two inhibitions. The calculated epistasis index of 20.233 shows that combinatorial inhibition of Src and PI3Ki s 23.3% more effective than
the addition of the effects of the separate inhibitions. For D–F , error bars indicate SEM of all cells ( n ¼ 3 biological replicates and at least 50
tracked cells per condition).
Figure 4 The underlying regulatory mechanism for cell migration. ( A)
Upon an extracellular cue for migration, the negative-feedback
modules Src/FAK/CSK and/or EGFR/PTP_EGFR generate the cyclical
signal. This signal drives the cyclical RhoA /Rac activities through the
regulation of Rho-GEFs, Rho-GAPs, and Rho-GDIs, thereby modulating
the cell migration by inducing iterative cyclic events of protrusions and
retractions. (B) The relationship between RhoA/Rac activity and cell mi-
gration for A2780 and A2780-Rab25. The cyclical RhoA/Rac activities
are required for cell migration, and the invasiveness of migrating
cells might be relative to the persistence of migration as observed by
the enhanced migration persistence of A2780-Rab25 cells by EGF
(right panel in Figure 1E).

through statistical analysis, the underlying mechanisms involved
still remain elusive. The modeling approach can be useful for unrav-
eling the hidden design principle in the underlying complex
molecular interaction network by systematically analyzing the
network dynamics using computer simulation ( Choi et al., 2012;
Shin et al., 2014). It can also be used to develop novel therapeutic
strategies that overcome drug resistance ( Lee et al., 2012; Won
et al., 2012). The proposed network modeling approach based on
attractor landscape analysis can be applied to any other complex
molecular interaction network to get a new insight into the under-
lying regulatory mechanism and identify new drug targets.
Materials and methods
Rac1 and Cdc42 activation assay
Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl, pH7.2, 1%
(w/v) Triton X- 100, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2) supplemented
with protease inhibitor PMSF ( 1 mM). Cleared lysates were incu-
bated with 10 mg of GST-PAK-CRIB beads for 30 min at 48C under
end-to-end rotation. The beads were washed with wash buffer
(50 mM Tris .Cl, pH 7.2, 1%( w/v) Triton X- 100, 150 mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitor PMSF (1 mM).
The beads were re-suspended alongside with the total lysate,
boiled in LDS Sample Buffer containing dithiothreitol ( 100 mM),
and western blotted. Anti-Rac 1 antibody (Millipore, clone 238A,
1:500)a n da n t i - C d c42 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-87,
1:500) were used to detect both total and active Rac 1 or Cdc42.
The western blot bands were quantiﬁed using ImageJ.
Live cell migration
Random cell migration assays were performed on cell lines
stably transduced with H 2B-mRFP. Cells were seeded on CDM-
coated plastic plates and images were captured every 10 min
using ﬂuorescence microscopy (excitation: 540 nm, emission:
588 nm) with an A-Plan 10×/0.25 ph1 objective, over a 12-h
period. Movies were analyzed using Bitplane Imaris (version
7.6.4) spot detection and tracking module, and the average
speeds and migration persistence of cells were calculated using
MATLABw software. Average speeds of cells were calculated
by averaging the average frame-to-frame speed of all cells.
Migration persistence was calculated by averaging the migration
persistence of all the cells. The migration persistence of each cell
is the total displacement divided by the total track length of the
cell. All migration experiments were performed in triplicates, with
at least50 tracked cells per condition.
RhoA activity assessed by FRET imaging
The RhoA biosensor was imaged in live cells as previously
described ( Hodgson et al., 2010). Cells were seeded on CDM-
coated glass-bottom plates. The biosensor-expressing cells were
imaged at10-sec intervals, using a Nikon Plan Apo 40×/1.5 DIC
oil objective on a spinning-disk laser confocal Nikon microscope
with Andor iXonEM+ EMCCD camera, using 4 averaged frames and
no binning, resulting in an effective pixel size of 234 nm. The
same excitation wavelength ( 445 nm) was used for both mTFP
and FRET channels, while 475 and 526 nm emission ﬁlters were
used for mTFP and FRET channels, respectively. Both mTFP and
FRET channels were captured at ≏75% of camera overexposure
using the same level of laser power (exposure time between
800–1000 msec for mTFP and 300–400 msec for FRET channel).
Twenty images from a cell-free area using the same settings were
also acquired for shading correction. The raw images were
de-noised with the ImageJ PureDenoise plugin ( Luisier et al.,
2010), and then were analyzed with the Biosensor Processing
Software 2.1 for MATLABw from the Danuser Lab (Hodgson et al.,
2010), using the default conﬁguration. The processed biosensor
images were normalized and compared by segmenting ( 35
windows) similar regions of boundaries of the cell using ImageJ
and plotting the average RhoA activity over time of each window
onto an activity map using MATLABw. In order to compare different
conditions quantitatively, all bursts of RhoA activities that were
followed by a protrusion were considered and manually counted
in all cells (n ¼ 3–5) for each condition, then averaged and plotted.
