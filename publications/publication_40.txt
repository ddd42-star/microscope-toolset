SUMMARY
Directional migration requires robust front/back po-
larity. We ﬁnd that ﬁbroblasts treated with platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF) and prepolarized by
plating on a ﬁbronectin line substrate exhibit persis-
tent migration for hours. This does not occur in the
absence of PDGF or on uniformly coated ﬁbronectin
substrates. Persistent migration arises from estab-
lishment of two functional modules at cell front and
back. At the front, formation of a zone containing po-
dosome-like structures (PLS) dynamically correlates
with low RhoA and myosin activity and absence of a
contractile lamella. At the back, myosin contractility
speciﬁcally controls tail retraction with minimal
crosstalk to the front module. The PLS zone is main-
tained in a dynamic steady state that preserves size
and position relative to the cell front, allowing for
long-term coordination of front and back modules.
We propose that front/back uncoupling achieved
by the PLS zone is crucial for persistent migration
in the absence of directional cues.
INTRODUCTION
Cells directionally migrate in response to gradients of immobi-
lized (haptotaxis) or diffusible (chemotaxis) cues ( Parsons
et al., 2010). Extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity or dimensionality
can also modulate this process (Petrie et al., 2009). Combina-
tions of these cues will affect parameters such as cell speed,
shape, and directionality, producing a continuum of cell migra-
tion modalities (Friedl and Wolf, 2010). Whereas the diversity of
cell migration modalities is well accepted, they have been
described in a wide variety of different model systems, making
fair comparisons difﬁcult. Accordingly, our understanding as to
how the dynamics of the migration machinery is modulated to
establish particular migration modes is still limited.
Fibroblasts are large mesenchymal cells that are mostly
involved in tissue repair. Due to their well-deﬁned cytoskeleton
organization, they have been a popular model system to study
actin and adhesion dynamics during cell migration. At the front,
two cytoskeletal modules are coupled with integrin-based
adhesion structures to allow cell propulsion ( Ponti et al.,
2004). The lamellipodium uses Arp2/3-mediated assembly of
an actin dendritic meshwork to propel the leading edge forward
(Pollard and Borisy, 2003). Nascent adhesions are formed and
can mature into focal complexes. Behind the lamellipodium,
the lamella consists of bundled actin and nonmuscle myosin
II ﬁlaments that provide a contractile network for traction.
Here, focal complexes mature into stress ﬁber-linked, elon-
gated focal adhesions (Parsons et al., 2010). Linkage of front
and back focal adhesions through stress ﬁbers, coupled with
propulsion of the leading edge, moves the cell forward, and
leads to disassembly of back focal adhesions and tail retrac-
tion. Podosomes are an additional type of adhesions that
consist of a central actin core associated with integrins and
other proteins (Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011 ). They are
observed in a wide variety of immune and cancer cells (Calle
et al., 2006 ) and are found in Src-transformed ﬁbroblasts
(Oikawa et al., 2008). Podosome substrate interaction leads
to local ECM degradation and invasion.
One important limitation of ﬁbroblasts is their moderate capa-
bility to robustly polarize during random migration on uniform
ECM ﬁelds (haptokinesis) or in response to global growth factor
stimulation (chemokinesis). Thus, on planar ECM substrates,
unrestricted membrane protrusion leads ﬁbroblasts to adopt
a wide variety of cellular shapes with various degrees of polariza-
tion. Although this is sufﬁcient to study the ﬁne dynamics of
membrane protrusion and tail retraction, it precludes the anal-
ysis of how both processes are coordinated to produce net
movement. In vivo, ﬁbroblasts interact with ECM structures of
speciﬁc geometries that inﬂuence cell polarization (Kim et al.,
2012). Hence, ﬁbroblasts migrating on micrometric ECM line
patterns exhibit increased migration speed and directionality
(Doyle et al., 2009). Mimicking the anisotropic ECM organization
observed in vivo therefore provides an opportunity to induce
robust ﬁbroblast polarization.
Rho family GTPases are key regulators of the spatio-tem-
poral organization of actin and adhesion dynamics during cell
migration. While initial models suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42
operate at the front to regulate membrane protrusion, and
RhoA functions at the back to control tail retraction (Burridge
and Wennerberg, 2004 ), recent studies using ﬂuorescence

resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors have indi-
cated a higher level of signaling complexity (Machacek et al.,
2009; Pertz et al., 2006). Most importantly, RhoA signaling is
also active at the cell front, where during ﬁbroblast haptokinesis,
two distinct activities are observed: Adjacent to the leading
edge, a focused region of RhoA activity is coupled to the initia-
tion of edge protrusion (Machacek et al., 2009). This is followed
by a broader gradient of RhoA activity reaching 10–15mm into
the lamella (Pertz et al., 2006). Rac1 and Cdc42 are also acti-
vated at the front, however, with a delay relative to protrusion
onset (Machacek et al., 2009). This organization is fundamentally
altered when ﬁbroblasts are acutely stimulated with platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF), which leads to heightened cell
edge protrusion and membrane rufﬂing. Here, RhoA activity is
displaced from the leading edge (Pertz et al., 2006), and suppos-
edly replaced by heightened Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. Hence,
dependent on the cue, different Rho GTPase signaling programs
are activated to induce distinct modes of cell migration.
In this paper, we dissect the mechanisms underlying the differ-
ences of ﬁbroblast haptokinesis and PDGF-induced chemokine-
sis on micropatterned ﬁbronectin (FN) line substrates. We ﬁnd
that PDGF-treated ﬁbroblasts exhibit persistent cell migration
for hours. This correlates with the formation of a zone containing
podosome-like structures (PLSs) directly behind the lamellipo-
dium that exhibits constant size and position. The PLS zone
dynamically correlates with low RhoA and myosin activity, and
precludes the formation of a lamella. Instead, myosin activity is
concentrated behind the PLS zone to promote tail retraction.
Thus, the PLS zone spatially organizes the formation of two
distinct modules, one for membrane protrusion and one for tail
retraction, enabling persistent migration.
RESULTS
PDGF Induces Persistent Migration of Prepolarized
Fibroblasts
To compare haptokinetic (hapto) and PDGF-induced chemoki-
netic (chemo) cell migration modes, we used REF52 rat embry-
onic ﬁbroblasts, a classic model system to study actin and
adhesion dynamics (Zamir et al., 1999). Throughout this work,
we used the following conditions: serum-starved REF52 ﬁbro-
blasts were plated on 10mg/ml FN-coated coverslips in absence
(hapto) or presence of 40 ng/ml PDGF (chemo). On uniformly
coated plane substrates, both hapto and chemo ﬁbroblasts
migrate randomly with an instantaneous speed of/C24 10 mm/hr
(Figures S1A–S1C available online). Although not signiﬁcant at
the population level, a fraction of chemo cells displayed
increased directional persistence (Figure S1B). To normalize
cell shape and mimic the anisotropic nature of the ECM
observed in vivo, we used plasma etching to construct 20mm
wide 10mg/ml FN lines separated by the nonadhesive compound
poly-L-Lysine-polyethylene glycol (PLL-PEG;Figure S1D). This
allowed FN coating at a density identical to the coat on the plane
substrate (Figures S1E and S1F). Hapto cells on line substrate
adopted an elongated morphology and exhibited similar instan-
taneous speed and persistence as on plane substrates (Figures
1A, 1B, andS1C). In contrast, chemo cells gradually sped up on
line substrates, reaching a 5-fold increase in instantaneous
speed within hours after PDGF stimulation and acquired a steady
state in which they stably migrated in one direction (Figures 1A–
1C). Both steady state speed and persistence scaled inversely
with the FN coating density (Figures S1G and S1H). The differ-
ences between hapto and chemo cells in terms of migration
properties were accompanied by acquisition of distinct cell mor-
phologies. Hapto cells were elongated and ﬂat, whereas chemo
cells exhibited a strongly rufﬂed leading edge, a thick cell body,
and an obvious trailing edge (Figure 1D). Together, these results
show that PDGF stimulation of ﬁbroblasts that are prepolarized
on a FN line substrate induces rapid, persistent, and unidirec-
tional cell migration.
Polarization of Chemo Cells Involves a Morphological
Transition with Uncoupling of Front and Back Motions
The cell shape normalization on the line substrate enabled us
to unambiguously deﬁne cell front and back and thus to study
their coordination. For that purpose, we acquired time-lapse
sequences of ﬁbroblasts stably expressing the F-actin marker
Lifeact-green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP;Riedl et al., 2008). To
quantify cell migration morphodynamics at relevant time scales,
we designed an automated segmentation algorithm to evaluate
the dynamics of front, centroid, and back parts (Figures 1E
and 1F; Movie S1). Hapto cells exhibited alternating left and
right motions, indicating the existence of transient polarization
episodes that impede persistent cell migration ( Figure 1G).
In contrast, a few hours after PDGF stimulation, chemo cells ac-
quired a stably polarized state of persistent migration (Figure 1G).
This correlated with increased speed and decreased cell length,
whereas these parameters remained constant throughout time in
hapto cells (Figure 1H).
We then evaluated the coordination between cell front and
back movements by performing time-dependent cross-correla-
tion analysis of velocity ﬂuctuations (Experimental Procedures
and Figure S1I). Hapto cells displayed transient episodes of
strongly positive and strongly negative cross-correlations
(Figures 1I and 1J), where front and back move coordinately in
identical or opposite directions. This indicates that at least during
episodes of comovement, front and back motions are coupled.
In contrast, chemo cells did not exhibit robust positive or nega-
tive cross-correlations (Figures 1I and 1J), suggesting that front
and back movements are uncoupled. Thus, establishment of
the steady state of persistent migration in chemo cells occurs
on time scales of hours and involves a morphological transition

that correlates with increased velocity. Furthermore, the polar-
ized steady state of chemo cells correlates with uncoupling of
front and back motions.
Chemo Cells Display Podosome-like Structures at the
Leading Edge
The distinct cell morphologies suggest that hapto and chemo
cell migration modes are mediated by different cytoskeletal
and adhesion dynamics. To test this we used high-resolution
immunostaining using epiﬂuorescence (EPI) and total internal
reﬂection ﬂuorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Transiently polarized
hapto cells displayed asymmetric distributions of front-enriched
stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions (Figure 2A). A network of trans-
verse stress ﬁbers connected leading edge and lateral focal
adhesions, whereas a lower amount of focal adhesions was
observed at the trailing edge. Focal adhesions at front and
back were connected by lateral stress ﬁbers. In contrast, stably
polarized chemo cells overall had fewer stress ﬁbers (Figure 2B).
A large region at the leading edge displayed dotted F-actin-rich/
vinculin-low PLSs (Figure 2B; red arrowheads, PLS; dotted blue
line, PLS zone). Although PLSs did not display the bona ﬁde F-
actin core surrounded by a ring containing adhesion structures
as observed in podosomes (Albiges-Rizo et al., 2009), they dis-
played proteolytic activity on a gelatin line substrate (Figure S2A)
and were enriched in cortactin (Figure S2B). Within the PLS
zone, we also observed F-actin-low/vinculin-rich structures not
connected to stress ﬁbers (Figure 2B, yellow arrowheads) that
were reminiscent of focal complexes. Focal adhesions were

absent within the PLS zone. Immediately behind the PLS zone,
TIRF microscopy revealed a network of ventrally localized trans-
verse actin ﬁbers (Figure 2C, white arrowhead). This network
was not connected to any adhesion structure in the cell center,
but associated with elongated focal adhesions conﬁned to the
lateral edges and the back of the cell (Figure 2C, blue arrow-
heads). To clearly distinguish these different adhesion struc-
tures, the relative enrichment between F-actin and vinculin or
paxillin ﬂuorescence signals in PLSs, focal complexes and focal
adhesions in chemo cells is quantitated inFigure 2D. Overall,
such organization with a PLS zone was observed in 70% of
chemo cells on lines (Figure S2C). These results indicate the ex-
istence of different actin and adhesion structures in hapto and
chemo cells.
Chemo Cells Lack a Contractile Lamella
We subsequently monitored actin dynamics in both cell migration
modes using the F-actin marker Lifeact-GFP (Movie S2). In hapto
cells, the lamellipodium remained continuously attached to the
substrate, leading to a highly adherent mode of membrane pro-
trusion (Figure 3A, lower panels). Formation of actin arcs (Hotulai-
nen and Lappalainen, 2006) indicated robust actin retrograde
ﬂow in the lamella as well as on the lateral sides (Figure 3A, kymo-
graphs 1 and 2, quantitated inFigure 3C). In marked contrast,
in chemo cells, the lamellipodium was characterized by rapid
bursts of ﬁlopodial and membrane protrusions that escaped the
TIRF illumination ﬁeld. This indicates a low adhesive protrusion
mode because these structures extend in Z before contacting
the substrate (Figure 3B, lower panels). Directly behind the lamel-
lipodium, the lamella was replaced by the PLS zone (Figure 3B,
kymograph 1) with absence of contractile, rearward-ﬂowing actin
arcs. This suggests that actin retrograde ﬂow is conﬁned to
the lamellipodium but mostly absent from the PLS zone. Live
cell imaging also revealed that PLSs speciﬁcally originate in the
lamellipodium that extends on the permissive FN substrate,
remain immobile with respect to the substrate (Figure 3B, kymo-
graph 1, red arrowheads), and display a lifetime of about 10 min
(Figure 3G). Accordingly, the PLS zone remained constant in
size throughout cell migration (Figure 3B, dotted white lines in
kymograph 1). Robust actin retrograde ﬂow persisted on the
sides as observed by inward ﬂow of lateral arcs (Figure 3B, kymo-
graph 2, quantitated inFigure 3C).
We then observed adhesion dynamics (Figures 3D–3G; Movie
S3) and noticed that chemo cell polarization and formation of
the PLS zone was highly sensitive to exogenous expression of
GFP-tagged cytoskeletal or adhesion proteins, even when sta-
bly expressed at low level. This required two-color imaging ex-
periments, in which we ﬁrst produced stable cell lines using a
lentiviral system for low expression of GFP-tagged proteins,
then used an adenovirus system to coexpress Lifeact-mCherry
for identiﬁcation of polarized chemo cells. We tested a number
of different constructs, and found that VASP-GFP was the adhe-
sion marker that was least perturbing. In hapto cells, focal com-
plexes immediately converted to focal adhesions, most likely
through interaction with the contractile lamella (Parsons et al.,
2010; Figures 3D and 3E;Movie S3, hapto, blue arrowheads).
These focal adhesions displayed typical centripetal sliding
behavior (Figure 3F) with a lifetime of approximately 30 min
(Figure 3G). Chemo cells displayed both PLSs (F-actin-high/
VASP-low, red arrowheads) and focal complexes (F-actin-low/
VASP-high, yellow arrowheads) at the leading edge (Figures
3D and 3E). Nonmotile PLSs grew and shrunk in lateral exten-
sion-decay cycles (Figure 3F, red arrowheads). Within the PLS
zone, VASP-GFP revealed that focal complexes also remained
immobile relative to the substrate (Figure 3F, yellow arrowheads)
and almost never matured into focal adhesions. Thus, they
display identical lifetimes as PLSs (Figure 3G). Elongated focal
adhesions were only observed on the lateral edges and at the
back of the cells, and exhibited sliding motions (Figure 3F,
chemo, blue arrowheads), most likely through pulling by the
SF array emanating from the cell center (Movie S3). Together,
these results show that the contractile lamella observed in hapto
cells is replaced by the PLS zone in chemo cells. Absence of a
contractile lamella correlates with loss of focal complex-focal
adhesions maturation within the PLS zone, leading to their turn-
over, and restricting focal adhesions to the back and lateral
sides of the cell.
Establishment of Steady-State, Persistent Chemo Cell
Migration Correlates with Appearance of the PLS Zone
The steady state of persistent chemo cell migration is acquired
hours after PDGF stimulation and is then characterized by a dy-
namic PLS zone at the leading edge. To explore how this polar-
ized steady state is established, we performed high-resolution
time-lapse imaging of F-actin dynamics during the ﬁrst 7 hr after
PDGF stimulation. On the line substrate, hapto cells continuously
exhibited robust, symmetric stress ﬁbers that correlate with left-
right motions impeding long-term polarization (Movie S4). PDGF
stimulation led to a stereotypical series of morphological states
that culminated in the steady state of polarized cell migration
(Figures 4A and 4B;Movie S4). Immediately after PDGF stimula-
tion, chemo cells on the line substrate exhibited intense rufﬂing,
which correlated with decreased amounts of stress ﬁbers. Two
to three hours later, a robust PLS zone suddenly appeared at
one cell edge, but the cell body was still adherent. Tens of
minutes later, the presence of a robust PLS zone and rounding
up of the cell body then correlated with persistent, rapid cell
migration. As already observed on smaller time scales, the PLS
zone remained at the leading edge and displayed constant
length (Figure 4C). These results indicate that acquisition of the
polarized steady state of persistent migration coincides with
appearance of the PLS zone.
The PLS Zone also Occurs in Chemo Cells on Plane
Substrates
On the plane substrate, hapto cells also continuously exhibited
prominent actin arcs that retrogradely ﬂowed inward throughout
the periphery (Movie S4). This correlated with robust focal adhe-
sion formation; however, with shorter lifetimes than on the line
substrate (Figures S3A–S3C and S3G). In chemo cells, PDGF
stimulation initially led to intense rufﬂing that then dampened
(Movie S4). This was followed by appearance of multiple PLS
zones that exhibit scanning motions at the cell periphery (Fig-
ure 4D) and were intermixed with regions of actin retrograde
ﬂow. These PLS zones were unstable and only persisted on
time scales of tens of minutes (Figure 4D; Movie S4). High-res-
olution analysis using TIRF indicated that PLSs were nonmotile
with respect to the substrate (Figures S3D–S3F) and displayed

shorter lifetimes than on the line substrate (on the order of 2–
3 min,Figure S3G). The apparent motile behavior of PLS zones,
observed at a global scale, resulted from cycles of single PLS
appearance/disappearance. Focal complexes present within
the PLS zone did not mature to focal adhesions and displayed
identical lifetimes than PLSs (Figure S3D–S3G). These cytoskel-

(hapto: 0.27 ± 0.06, n = 13 cells; chemo: 0.17 ± 0.04, n = 16
cells, ***p < 0.0001). These results show that on the plane sub-
strate, transient establishment of PLS zones associates with
localized loss of contractile structures such as actin arcs and
focal adhesions and only correlates with mild polarization. On
the line substrate, the PLS zone is geometrically conﬁned
and correlates with loss of contractile networks and lamella
formation at one cell edge, which is associated with robust
polarization.
Hapto and Chemo Cells Display Different Leading Edge
Dynamics
We next investigated the dynamics of the leading edge in high-
resolution time-lapse sequences sampled at 5 s per frame. We
quantiﬁed the dynamics of edge protrusion and retraction as
previously described (Machacek and Danuser, 2006). Protrusion
velocity maps were generated for hapto and chemo cells both on
plane and line substrates (Figures 5A–5D) and statistically eval-
uated (Figures 5E–5G). Hapto cells on the plane substrate

displayed poorly protrusive edges, with low velocities and
no obvious persistence (Figure 5A). Spatial clustering of locally
measured edge velocities revealed two populations of edge dy-
namics in chemo cells on the plane substrate. Remarkably, they
speciﬁcally associated either with the PLS zone (red edge) or
contractile networks (blue edge;Figure 5B). Whereas the speed
of the PLS-associated edge was enhanced, it displayed low pro-
trusive persistence, but still promoted efﬁcient net protrusion.
The contractile edge displayed similar properties as those
observed in hapto cells (which had only one type of protrusion
dynamics). On the line substrate, hapto cells displayed a slight
enhancement of edge velocity and protrusion persistence (Fig-
ure 5C). Chemo cells displayed enhancement of both protrusion
persistence and speed, resulting in a higher net protrusive
activity (Figure 5D, red edges). These results indicate that the
noncontractile PLS zone associates with a highly protrusive
leading edge, prominently on line substrates, but present also
locally on plane substrates.
Chemo Cells Assemble a Myosin Cluster Directly behind
the PLS Zone for Trailing Edge Retraction
The absence of a contractile lamella in chemo cells raised the
question of their migration dependence on nonmuscle myosin
II (myosin)-based contractility. To address this, we evaluated
the subcellular localization and dynamics of myosin light chain
2a (MLC2a) and of its active Ser19 phosphostate (pMLC). In
hapto cells, pMLC and MLC2a prominently decorated stress
ﬁbers (Figures 6A andS4A, Hapto), whereas pMLC additionally
labeled the lamella (Figure 6A, Hapto, red arrowhead). Identical
patterns were observed on plane substrates ( Figure S4B,
Hapto). In contrast, both pMLC and MLC2a were absent from
the chemo cell front and localized to a cortical cluster positioned
behind the PLS zone, that coincided with the transverse stress
ﬁber array that connects to focal adhesions at the lateral sides
and back of the cell (Figures 6A and S4A, Chemo, red arrow-
head). Outside the cluster, faint MLC2a staining remained
present on these stress ﬁbers. On the plane substrate, chemo
cells displayed mixed pMLC patterns: whereas the PLS zone
was devoid of any pMLC signal, pMLC localized both as a cluster
adjacent to the PLS zone, as well as to peripheral contractile
arrays (Figure S4B, Chemo). Live imaging of MLC2a-GFP and
Lifeact-mCherry dynamics revealed constant association be-
tween MLC2a and stress ﬁbers in hapto cells (Figures 6B and
6C, Hapto; Movie S5). In chemo cells, apposed but mutually
exclusive PLS and MLC2a zones of constant size occurred
throughout cell migration (Figures 6B and 6C, Chemo;Movie S5).
To test the functional signiﬁcance of myosin-based contrac-
tility, we used blebbistatin (Straight et al., 2003) to acutely inhibit
myosin ATPase activity (Figure S4C, Hapto). Whole cell kymo-
graph analysis showed that hapto cells lost their transient polar-
ized state by extending uncontrolled membrane protrusions
in all directions (Figure 6D; Movie S6), which correlated with a
decrease in front/back coordination (Figure 6F, Hapto). Chemo
cells were speciﬁcally impaired in tail retraction, but displayed
almost unaffected leading edge membrane protrusion ( Fig-
ure 6E). This correlated with loss of the pMLC cluster in chemo
cells without affecting PLSs (Figure S4C, Chemo). On a time
scale of 12 hr, loss of myosin-based contractility decreased
chemo cell migration persistence without affecting speed (Fig-
ures 6G and 6H). This occurred because of extreme stretching
of chemo cells that ultimately led to their turning. Blebbistatin-
treated hapto cells displayed no decrease in speed (Figures
6G and 6H). These results show that myosin activity occurs
in the lamella and stress ﬁber network of hapto cells, and its
inhibition deregulates overall edge protrusion and migration.
In contrast, in chemo cells, PLSs establish functionally distinct
cytoskeleton structures, one without (front), and one with
(back) myosin-driven contractility. Myosin inhibition then only
affects tail retraction whereas the lamellipodial machinery in front
of the PLS remains intact.
Inhibition of the PLS Zone Rescues a Contractile
Lamella in Chemo Cells
The lack of myosin activity within the PLS zone of chemo cells
prompted us to explore if it directly inhibited contractile function.
To this end, we tested a panel of drugs and identiﬁed the Arp2/3
inhibitor CK666 (Nolen et al., 2009) and the Src inhibitor PP2 (Oi-
kawa et al., 2008) as appropriate compounds to acutely remove
PLSs. Indeed, CK666 does not only affect PLSs, but also Arp2/3
pools involved in lamellipodial protrusion. Consistently, in both
hapto and chemo cells, treatment with 200mM CK666 led to
the appearance of spiky protrusions (Figure 7A; Movie S6)a s
previously described (Wu et al., 2012). This however did not
markedly inhibit cell migration for 1 hr. Adhesion dynamics in
hapto cells were only minimally affected (Figure 7A, blue arrow-
heads; Movie S7), as well as pMLC signals (Figure 7B, Hapto). In
chemo cells, CK666 treatment led to rapid removal of PLSs,
which was concomitant with immediate appearance of stress ﬁ-
bers and focal adhesions at the leading edge (Figure 7A, blue ar-
rowheads; Movie S7). pMLC signals relocalized from the back of
the PLS zone to the leading edge, in a pattern reminiscent of the
lamella of hapto cells (Figure 7B). CK666 treatment did however
not revert chemo cells to a contractile state as intense as in hapto
cells. At a global level, CK666 only minimally affected hapto cell
morphodynamics, with temporal cross-correlation analysis still
indicating the presence of front/back coordination (Figures 7C
and 7E;Movie S6). Chemo cells, however, only remained polar-
ized for approximately 1 hr after CK666 treatment, and then lost
persistent migration (Figure 7D; Movie S6). During this ﬁrst 1-hr
polarized cell migration episode, strong front/back motion corre-
lations were observed, indicating that abrogation of the PLS led
to linkage of cell front and back (Figure 7F). To strengthen these
results, we inhibited Src using 12.5mM PP2, which led to imme-
diate removal of PLSs in chemo cells. Although this only margin-
ally affected focal adhesion dynamics and pMLC signals in hapto
cells (Figures S5A and S5C), immediate maturation of focal com-
plexes to focal adhesions and rescue of leading edge pMLC sig-
nals occurred in chemo cells upon PLS disruption in 3–4 min
(Figures S5B and S5D). At longer time scales, Src inhibition
also affected tail retraction, precluding the analysis of global
cell migration properties. Together, these results indicate that
the PLS zone inhibits myosin contractility responsible for lamella
formation, which is required for front/back uncoupling.

zone prompted us to explore any potential role for RhoA
signaling using RhoA2G, a FRET-based biosensor of RhoA acti-
vation (Fritz et al., 2013). In hapto cells, both on the line and
plane substrates, RhoA was activated as a broad gradient span-
ning the entire lamella with activity decreasing from the leading
edge to the cell center (Figures 8A and 8B, Hapto;Movie S8).
This most likely results from an integrin-mediated mechano-
sensing pathway impinging on RhoA (Guilluy et al., 2011). In
chemo cells, low RhoA activity was observed at the PLS zone,
but a highly focused region of lamellipodial RhoA activity re-
mained (Figure 8A, Chemo;Movie S8). On the plane substrate,
dynamic PLS motion correlated with local decrease of the
lamellar RhoA activity, which immediately reappeared at sub-
cellular regions in which PLSs vanish (Figure 8B, Chemo). This
indicates an intimate spatio-temporal relationship between
PLSs and low RhoA activity. We then acutely disrupted the
PLS zone using CK666. In hapto cells, this did not affect the
broad gradient of lamellar RhoA activity on both plane and
line substrates (Figures 8C and 8D). In contrast, CK666-induced
PLS disruption rescued the broad RhoA activation gradient
at the front of chemo cells (Figure 8E). Identical results were
observed on the plane substrate, again without any effect on
RhoA activity in lamellar regions (Figure 8F). This indicates
that the effects of CK666-mediated Arp2/3 inhibition on RhoA
speciﬁcally correlate with PLS disruption, but do not affect
lamellar RhoA signaling. Finally, identical results were obtained
with the Src inhibitor PP2. PP2-induced PLS removal again led
to immediate rescue of the broad RhoA activation pattern at the

front of chemo cells, without however affecting lamellar RhoA
activity in hapto cells (Figures S5E and S5F). These results
indicate that the low contractility observed in the PLS zone
correlates with decreased RhoA activity at this speciﬁc subcel-
lular location.
DISCUSSION
PLSs Serve as a Spatially Organizing Module to Polarize
Fibroblasts
Fibroblast migration has classically been studied on planar
substrates with uniform coating that does not allow strong cell
polarization. We show that PDGF stimulation of prepolarized
ﬁbroblasts leads to rapid and persistent migration in one direction
for hours, in the absence of any gradient. Both initiation and main-
tenance of this polarized steady state correlates with the formation
of a PLS zone, which allows to shape a subcellular region that ex-
hibits low contractility (as characterized by loss of actin arcs and
focal complex-focal adhesion maturation, and low myosin/RhoA
activity). Such PLSs are not bona ﬁde podosomes as described
in macrophages (Calle et al., 2006) or in Src-transformed ﬁbro-
blasts (Oikawa et al., 2008). However, similar structures have
been observed before in NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts (Collin et al., 2006).
Sustained persistent migration correlates with two emergent
properties of the system. First, ﬁbroblast prepolarization
geometrically constrains the PLS zone proximal to the leading
edge to hinder lamella formation, restricting contraction to the
back of the cell. The establishment of a noncontractile, protru-
sive front and a contractile back allows for front/back uncoupling
and efﬁcient cell symmetry breaking. On the plane substrate,
PLS zones with an identical function in the local decrease of
lamellar contractility also exist. However, these only allow mod-
erate polarization, most likely because they only disrupt the con-
tractile lamellar networks observed throughout the cell periphery
in local subsectors. Second, the dynamic properties of PLSs
(Figures 3D and 3E) maintain the size and relative position of
the PLS zone with time, indicating that PLSs function as a
spatially organizing module that appropriately positions and
coordinates front lamellipodium protrusion with back myosin
retraction throughout the cell migration process. Future studies
will be aimed at understanding the signaling and biophysical
mechanisms that enable shaping of the mesoscale properties
of the PLS zone. Similar spatially organizing cytoskeletal mod-
ules have already been proposed to regulate cytoskeletal polar-
ity in neutrophils (Weiner et al., 2007). In the latter cells, the higher
cytoskeletal plasticity and the intrinsically asymmetric cell shape
might explain the absence of a requirement for prepolarization. It
is also worth mentioning that persistent ﬁbroblast migration has
also been observed on 1 (but not 20)mm wide FN line substrate,
which additionally mimic 3D ECM dimensionality (Doyle et al.,
2009). However, this occurs in the absence of PLS structures,
indicating that persistent migration can be mediated by multiple
pathways. The requirement of a cytoskeletal, spatially organizing
module for cell polarization has important consequences for
experimental analysis of this system: signaling events that regu-
late cytoskeletal dynamics during persistent migration cannot
be perturbed before acquisition of a polarized steady state,
and thus, acute perturbations by pharmacological inhibition
have to be used to study these pathways.
Functional Consequences of Front/Back Uncoupling
An important feature of persistent chemo cell migration is the un-
coupling of front and back motions. The current model for front/
back coordination of ﬁbroblast migration posits that contraction
of stress ﬁbers connected to focal adhesions at the front gener-
ates forces on focal adhesions in the rear, promoting disas-
sembly and tail retraction (Parsons et al., 2010). In prepolarized
hapto cells, stress ﬁber arrays along the cell length indeed
induce mechanical coupling between focal adhesions in the
lamella and focal adhesions at the cell rear. However, this me-
chanical linkage admits only transient polarization episodes,
and is insufﬁcient to establish persistent migration. Although
we cannot formally exclude that chemical signals lead to uncou-
pling of front/back motions in chemo cells, the ﬁnding that the
PLS zone disrupts formation of a contractile lamella, restricts
stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions to the back and lateral parts
of the cell, strongly suggests that the nature of the front/back un-
coupling is mechanical by nature. Perturbation of the PLS zone
using the CK666 compound leads to a rapid increase of myosin
activity at the cell front, which is accompanied by focal adhesion
maturation. This translates into front/back coupling and ulti-
mately to loss of persistent migration. This strongly suggests
the need for cell front and back uncoupling to maintain cell polar-
ity and persistent migration.
One consequence of front/back uncoupling is the concentra-
tion of myosin activity behind the PLS zone promoting tail retrac-
tion. Surprisingly, stress ﬁbers emanating from behind the PLS
are not anchored to any adhesion structure within the myosin
cluster. Most likely, the concentrated myosin zone is anchored
at the back of the PLS zone through interaction with the lateral
stress ﬁber-focal adhesion array. Importantly, chemo cells
display lower levels of stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions. There-
fore, adhesion and contraction strength in these cells are
adjusted so that lower rear contractility is still sufﬁcient to pro-
mote rear focal adhesions disassembly. Similar myosin clusters
have been observed at the back but not at the front of neutrophils
(Pestonjamasp et al., 2006) and ﬁsh keratocytes (Svitkina et al.,
1997), which both migrate rapidly and highly persistently. Hence,
we speculate that a rear-concentrated myosin module may be a
general feature of rapid, persistent migration.
An additional consequence of front/back uncoupling is the
appearance of a potent increase in protrusion velocity and persis-
tence at the front. This seems to enable highly processive leading
edge advancement that might explain the rapid migration speed
of chemo cells. Here, the absence of a contractile lamella might
optimize the functional output of the lamellipodial actin treadmill
at the leading edge. Our data imply that the Arp2/3 complex is
involved but not required for this membrane protrusion mode.
Together, these observations suggest that front/back uncoupling
leads to fast cell migration by promoting efﬁcient lamellipodial
protrusion without inhibitory lamellar contraction at the front
and by forming a loosely anchored myosin module that is just
strong enough to dissolve rear focal adhesions.
Spatiotemporal Control of RhoA Activity at the PLS Zone
Our FRET imaging studies suggest that a broad gradient of RhoA
in hapto cells from the leading edge regulates lamellar myosin
contractility, most likely through Rho kinase-mediated control
of MLC (Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004). In chemo cells, the
Developmental Cell

PLS zone dynamically correlates with reduced RhoA activity.
Acute removal of the PLS zone using two pharmacological com-
pounds that operate through distinct modes of action, and do not
affect lamellar RhoA activity, restores the broad RhoA activity
gradient, pMLC signal, and contractile structures. This indicates
a local, negative reciprocal crosstalk between PLSs and RhoA
within the PLS zone. By locally lowering contractility, PLSs might
switch off a positive feedback in which RhoA-speciﬁc GEFs such
as LARG or GEF-H1 (Guilluy et al., 2011) translate mechanical
activation of integrins by contractile forces into RhoA activation
upstream of myosin II. An interesting result is that, in absence
of a lamella, chemo cells still display a highly focused zone of
active RhoA directly in the lamellipodium not visible in hapto cells.
Our previous work has already established that two pools of
RhoA activity can exist at the leading edge: a broad gradient
and a focused band directly at the edge that correlates specif-
ically with the onset of robust membrane protrusion (Machacek
et al., 2009; Pertz et al., 2006). We propose that in chemo cells
the former is switched off in conjunction with the inhibition of
the lamella by the PLS, leaving the edge-focused RhoA activity
pool to regulate membrane protrusion, e.g., through the effectors
mDia1/2 (Palazzo et al., 2001). As previously documented (Pertz
et al., 2006), additional RhoA activation pools can be observed in
retracting tails (Figures 8C and 8E), but not at the myosin cluster
observed behind the PLS zone in chemo cells. These results
reveal a complex spatiotemporal RhoA activation landscape
that correlates with the induction of speciﬁc cytoskeletal struc-
tures. This also suggests the existence of multiple signaling path-
ways that regulate different subcellular myosin pools.
Signiﬁcance of Chemokinesis in Directional Cell
Migration
Our results show that growth factor-induced, persistent ﬁbro-
blast migration does not necessarily require a chemotactic
gradient. Chemokinesis is sufﬁcient to lock the cell in a polarized
state of persistent migration. This has important consequences
for the regulation of directed cell migration in vivo. During devel-
opment, this might be useful during collective, directional migra-
tion of neural crest cells, in which chemokinesis and contact
inhibition cooperate to generate an overall polarity to the cell
population (Theveneau and Mayor, 2012). During cancer metas-
tasis, a macrophage-tumor cell paracrine loop that involves
secretion of growth factors from the two different cell types
allows for collective cell streaming in one speciﬁc direction on
collagen ﬁbrils (Roussos et al., 2011). Although this was pro-
posed to involve chemotaxis, it is conceivable that chemokinesis
might be sufﬁcient to induce directional cell movement on the
highly asymmetric collagen ﬁber. In both cases, the ability of a
chemokinetic stimulus to hardwire directionality of prepolarized
cells might therefore provide a means for generation of persis-
tent, directional cell migration.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Line Substrate Microfabrication
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ridge stamps were used as a template to pro-
duce the line substrate (20mm wide ridge structures separated by 100mm
wide gaps) on glass coverslips (Figure S1D). PDMS was mixed well in a ratio
of 10:1 with curing agent (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomere KIT; Dow Corning)
and poured onto a silicon wafer produced by soft lithography. Vacuum was
applied to remove enclosed air bubbles and PDMS was cured by incubation
for 2 hr at 70/C14 C. The polymer was then peeled off the silicon wafer and cut
into pieces with adequate dimensions. PDMS-based live cell chambers con-
sisting of a square chamber (5 mm width, 6 mm length, 100mm high roof) con-
nected to an inlet and an outlet were constructed the same way using speciﬁc
silicon wafers.
Glass coverslips (243 50 mm) were extensively cleaned with anhydrous
ethanol and demineralized water and were coated with 0.5 mg/ml poly-Lly-
sine-polyethylene glycol, (PLL-PEG; SUSOS) for 30 min at room temperature.
Next, the glass coverslip was once washed with water and dried. In the mean-
while, the PDMS ridge stamp and PDMS live cell chamber were cleaned with
tape at the structured surface. The PDMS ridge stamp was then aligned on the
PLL-PEG coated surface of the glass coverslip and exposed to plasma etching
at 100% power for 90 s using a CUTE plasma oven (Femto Science). The glass
coverslips (with PDMS ridge stamp) as well as the PDMS-based live cell imag-
ing chamber (structured side up) were treated with plasma for an additional
30 s. The PDMS ridge stamp was then removed and the PDMS-based live
cell-imaging chamber was grafted on the glass coverslip on top of the line
substrate. Once the PDMS-based live cell-imaging chamber was covalently
bound to the glass coverslip, ﬁbronectin was coated overnight at 4/C14 Ca t
10 mg/ml. Line substrates were then washed once with PBS and once with im-
aging medium. Five microliters of a suspension containing 23 105 cells/ml
was loaded into the microﬂuidic device. Loading cells in such a small volume
minimized ﬂow and improved cell attachment. After 30 min, when cells had
adhered, the inlet and outlet of the microﬂuidic device were ﬁlled with imaging
medium and the devices were kept in an incubator until live cell imaging.
Image Analysis
Basic image analysis and processing was performed using MetaMorph
software. FRET data were analyzed as described elsewhere (Fritz et al.,
2013). Cell edge dynamics as shown inFigure 4were quantiﬁed using in-house
MATLAB-based software (MathWorks). This software calculates the velocities
by tracking the displacement of all pixels at the cell edge from one frame to the
next (Machacek and Danuser, 2006). The pixel-wise velocities were averaged
within sampling windows of approximately 1mm width placed along the cell
edge. This averaging step gave rise to the ﬁnal velocities used for analysis.
We further analyzed the edge dynamics by clustering regions of the cell
edge with similar velocity magnitude. A fuzzy k-means algorithm was used
for this purpose (Nock and Nielsen, 2006).
Analysis of Global Fibroblast Morphodynamics
To analyze global properties of ﬁbroblasts migrating on the line substrate,
a computer vision algorithm was developed to measure the kinematic
parameters from different cell regions. These analyses were all performed
on time-lapse movies of ﬁbroblasts stably expressing Lifeact-GFP, which pro-
vide adequate contrast for the segmentation of the cell boundary using inten-
sity-based thresholding. The basic idea behind this algorithm is to separately
capture the motion from the left, central, and right regions of the cell by
reducing these areas to single points. After segmentation, the algorithm calcu-
lates the cell centroid. The centroid point is then used to divide the cell in half
where the dividing plane is perpendicular to the long axis of the migration path.
Once divided, each cell half is reﬂected over the same dividing plane to form a
closed symmetric object. An ellipse is then inscribed to both objects and
the foci coordinates are calculated (Figure 1E). The right and left ellipse foci
from the right and left mirrored halves, respectively, were used to quantify
the motion for the right and left regions. The motion of the center region was
quantiﬁed by the centroid. Two important aspects are achieved with this
approach: independence between right/left measurements and the ability
to include local cell morphology from the right/left regions to capture their
respective motions. In addition to the velocities described above, the algo-
rithm also calculates the cell length (Figure 1H).
Cell Velocity Analysis
Visual inspection of hapto and chemo cells revealed a clear difference of
cell displacement over time. To quantify the different migration modes, we im-
plemented an algorithm based on a time series analysis technique called
empirical mode decomposition (Wu et al., 2007). This algorithm locally decom-
poses the centroid instantaneous velocity into two frequency components:
a fast component (including quick changes in velocity direction) and a slow
Developmental Cell

component (including the overall trend in velocity). The fast component was
used to estimate an interval that represents the distribution of magnitudes
for the fast, quasirandom changes in velocity. The interval was locally esti-
mated using a sliding window of 10 points with reﬂective boundaries in order
to accommodate temporal variations of the fast component. The range values
were calculated from the spread of the fast component within the 10 points
window (±3 SD centered in 0).
We deﬁned as bidirectional migration, periods in which the slow component
of the centroid velocity was contained in the fast component interval. That
means the cell changes direction from one frame to the next, having little or
no displacement. Unidirectional migration mode was deﬁned as periods in
which the slow component is outside the fast component interval. Although
there is a possibility of change in direction, this scenario indicates that the
cell has an overall displacement in one direction. We used left-to-right as
the direction of positive migration. The front region of the cell was deﬁned as
the side corresponding to the direction of centroid motion and left/right foci
velocities were labeled as front/back accordingly (Figure 1G).
Front/Back Coordination Quantiﬁcation
We used time-dependent cross-correlation to test the coordination between
the front and back regions of the cell. Given two time seriesxðtÞ and yðtÞ,
the time-dependent cross-correlation is deﬁned as:
rðtÞ = 1
W + 1
Xt + W=2
i = t/C0 W=2
ðyi /C0 yÞðxi /C0 xÞ
sy sx
;
where W + 1 is the length of the sliding window andsx; sy; x; y denote the SDs
and means forx and y within the sliding window. The coupling between front
and back regions was estimated by replacingx and y with front/back instan-
taneous velocities. Positive values indicate front and back moving in the
same direction. The conﬁdence interval around zero correlation was estimated
based on asymptotic distribution analysis for the cross-correlation of two
random Gaussian processes (Box et al., 1994). Correlations values inside
this interval are statistically insigniﬁcant.
Average Cross-Correlation Distributions
The time-dependent cross-correlation plots showed a transient nature of
the front/back coordination with periods of negative, insigniﬁcant, and positive
cross-correlation. To better summarize this variability in behavior for the entire
data set, we plotted the 2D distribution of the interval length and its respective
average cross-correlation for three qualitative behaviors (Figure S1I).

Procedures.
