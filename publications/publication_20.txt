ABSTRACT: The incidence of melanoma, the most fatal dermato-
logical cancer, has dramatically increased over the last few decades.
Modern targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors induces potent
clinical responses, but drug resistance quickly develops. Combination
therapy improves treatment outcomes. Therefore, novel inhibitors
targeting aberrant proliferative signaling in melanoma via the MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways are urgently needed. Biosensors were
combined that report on ERK/AKT activity with image-based high-
content screening and HPLC-based activity proﬁling. An in-house
library of 2576 plant extracts was screened on two melanoma cell
lines with diﬀerent oncogenic mutations leading to pathological
ERK/AKT activity. Out of 140 plant extract hits, 44 were selected for
HPLC activity proﬁling. Active thymol derivatives and piperamides fromArnica montana and Piper nigrum were identiﬁed that
inhibited pathological ERK and/or AKT activity. The pipeline used enabled an eﬃcient identiﬁcation of natural products targeting
oncogenic signaling in melanoma.
T
he incidence of melanoma, the most fatal dermatological
cancer, has increased dramatically over the last several
decades.1 Frequent mutations are found in the MAPK/ERK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regu-
lated kinase) and PI3K/AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AK
strain transforming kinase) pathways, which are involved in the
proliferation and in the survival and regulation of metabolism
(Figure S1, Supporting Information).2 In approximately 50%
of all metastatic melanoma cases, an activatingBRAF (v-raf
murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) V600
mutation is found. This mutation drives aberrant MAPK/
ERK pathway activation and tumor progression. To date, three
drugs targeting BRAF V600, namely, vemurafenib, dabrafenib,
and encorafenib, have been approved by the U.S. FDA. These
agents show signi ﬁcant beneﬁts regarding overall survival,
progression-free survival, and promising overall response rates.
Nevertheless, about 50% of patients relapse within theﬁrst 6−
8 months of drug therapy due to drug resistance, leading to
reactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, and the median
overall survival is 14 months.3,4
Another critical signaling pathway regulating survival,
apoptosis, and growth is the PI3K/AKT pathway. It is
activated in over 20% of relapsed patients and, therefore, is
an additional promising target in melanoma. 5,6 PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
10) is the main negative regulator of PI3K, and loss of PTEN
function leads to constitutive AKT activation. Loss of function
of PTEN is observed in 10−30% of malignant melanomas.
Mutation of the small GTPase NRAS (NRAS Q61K
mutation), in addition to impacting ERK, also leads to
constitutive activation of PI3Ks, leading to AKT activity. 7
There are, however, no PI3K-AKT inhibitors used currently in
the clinical treatment of melanoma.8
One strategy to overcome these types of drug resistances
involves the use of combination therapies. Combinations of
BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitors
indeed have shown increased clinical response rates and
improved progression-free and overall survival.9 Combination
therapy has thus become the standard treatment for advanced-
stage melanoma patients harboringBRAF V600 mutations.10
Moreover, as both the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways
can be mutated and contribute to oncogenic proliferation and
survival, targeting both pathways simultaneously represents a
promising therapeutic strategy. Preclinical success on cancer
cell lines and tumor xenografts has already led to several

clinical studies of combination therapies targeting the two
pathways. Unfortunately, however, the few trials that were
conducted have revealed poor tolerability of these combina-
tions, precluding optimal therapeutic dosing. 11 In contrast,
preclinical studies with dual AKT/ERK inhibitors, such as
ONC201, have shown promising results.12 There is therefore
no doubt that novel compounds targeting oncogenic MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in melanoma would add to the
drug arsenal for combination therapy.
Identifying new MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway
inhibitors may involve either a target-based or a phenotype-
based approach. The target-based approach starts with a
Figure 1.Overview of the screening pipeline. A total of 2576 plant extracts from 140 diﬀerent plant families were screened with the HCS assay. Of
the 140 hits, the 44 most promising extracts were submitted to HPLC-based activity proﬁling. Scale-up work on two extracts led to the isolation of
12 compounds belonging to two diﬀerent scaﬀolds.

deﬁned molecular target that is assumed to impact the disease.
In the case of melanoma, BRAF V600E was validated as a
target by diﬀerent in vitro and in vivo studies.13−17 A fragment-
based screening on several kinases, followed by cocrystallo-
graphic screening with BRAF, led to the discovery of
vemurafenib.18 In principle, it would be possible to perform
similar approaches for all possible targets in the MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT pathways. However, this would require a
signiﬁcant e ﬀort and high costs. In contrast, phenotypic
screens typically measure alterations in cell properties such as
morphology, levels of various proteins, or functional properties
such as cell proliferation. A major challenge then consists in
the identiﬁcation of the target and its mechanism of action.
Herein were used genetically encoded biosensors based on
kinase translocation reporter (KTR) technology that report on
ERK and AKT kinase activity directly in single cells.19 This
enables compounds to be identiﬁed that target proteins in
pathways induced by oncogenic mutations. Identiﬁcation of
compounds operating directly within living cells can take into
account the robustness of signaling networks leading to tumor
adaptation and resistance.20,21
Translating this biosensor technology to a medium-
throughput high-content screen (HCS) format enabled the
eﬃcient screening of a large plant extract library, and
subsequent HPLC activity proﬁling was used to select the
most promising extracts for targeted isolation (Figure 1).22
The approach taken is illustrated by isolation of bioactive
compounds from Arnica montana L. (Asteraceae) and Piper
nigrum L. (Piperaceae).
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
HCS Assay Development. To measure simultaneously
ERK and AKT activity in single cells, cell lines were produced
stably expressing ERK-KTR fused to an mScarlett ﬂuoro-
phore23 and AKT-KTR consisting of a mutated forkhead box
protein 1 allele fused to an mNeonGreen ﬂuorophore24
(Figure 2A). These spectrally compatible biosensors measure
ERK and AKT activity depending on their cytosolic (ON
state) versus nuclear (OFF state) localizations. Two diﬀerent
melanoma cell lines expressing both biosensors were produced.
The A2058 human melanoma cell line harbors the classical
BRAF V600E mutation leading to constitutive ERK activation,
as well as aPTEN deletion, producing PI3K and subsequent
AKT activation. The MM121224 patient-derived cell line also
harbors the BRAF V600E mutation, but bears an additional
NRAS Q61K mutation that leads to elevated PI3K/AKT
signaling (Figure 2B).25 It must be noted that the MM121224
line originated from a patient with a primaryBRAF V600E
mutation, whose cells acquired a second NRAS Q61K
mutation in response to BRAF inhibition targeted therapy.26
This cell line therefore represents a model for genetic drug
resistance. Thus, both cell lines exhibit high ERK and AKT
activity, with the elevated AKT activity emerging through
diﬀerent mechanisms due to diﬀerent oncogenes.
Imaging of ERK and AKT-K TR revealed prominent
cytosolic ﬂuorescence indicating high ERK/AKT activity in
MM121224 cells (Figure 2C). The nuclei were visualized using
a histone H2B-mTurquoise fusion protein (while A2058 cells
were DAPI stained). The high brightness of the biosensor
system permitted measurements using 10 × air objectives
compatible with a high-content screening microscope. Treat-
ment with the ERK pathway inhibitor cobimetinib led to the
inhibition of ERK activity as documented by nuclear ERK-
KTR relocalization (Figure 2C), without any eﬀect on AKT
activity. In turn, treatment with the PI3K-speciﬁc inhibitor
GDC0941 led to AKT inhibition without any eﬀect on ERK
activity. These results showed that the two biosensors
speciﬁcally report on elevated ERK and AKT activities in the
MM121224 cell line.
To quantify the ERK and AKT activities, an image analysis
workﬂow was established in which each cell nucleus in an
image was segmented. The nuclei were used to derive two
regions of interest: a nucleus mask and a cytosol mask that
consists of a ring of a speciﬁc width around the nucleus and
that is contained within the cytosol (Figure 3C). The ratios of
the median pixel values of the cytosolic over the nuclear mask
(C/N ratio) were calculated. Thus, high C/N ratios are
indicative of high ERK/AKT activities (and vice versa). The
functionality of the biosensors was conﬁrmed with the known
inhibitors cobimetinib and GDC0941 via a concentration-
dependent response of ERK and AKT activities (Figure 2D).
Similar results were observed in A2058 cells with cobimetinib
and AZD5363 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). These
data conﬁrm that ERK and AKT-KTR biosensors quantita-
tively and speciﬁcally measure ERK and AKT activities in
single cells.
Next, the biosensor assay was adapted for high-content
screening of the available plant extract library. The diﬀerent
steps of the experimental/computational work ﬂow are
depicted inFigure 3. Cells were plated at subconﬂuent density
in 96-well plates, providing suﬃcient cell measurements for
robust statistics. A treatment duration of 2 h with plant extracts
was chosen to avoid potential cytotoxicity that might hamper
the biosensor measurements owing to cell morphology
changes. This experimental modality was also more likely to
measure a direct impact on MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT

microscopy was used for image acquisition. (C) Each cell was segmented into the nucleus (shown in yellow) and the cytosol (shown in purple),

signaling before potential long-term adaptation due to
transcriptional rewiring of signaling pathways occurs.27,28
Since the extract library used DMSO as a solvent, the
DMSO tolerance was determined for both cell lines.
Fluorescence signals and cell health were not aﬀected at
DMSO concentrations of≤0.75% (data not shown). Given a
10 mg/mL concentration of library stock solutions, the highest
extract concentration to be tested was 75μg/mL. All extracts
were screened in duplicate. Images were acquired inﬁxed cells
for ERK-KTR, AKT-KTR, and nuclei using a high-content
microscopy platform (Figure 3B). Single-cell ERK and AKT-
KTR C/N ﬂuorescence ratios were extracted using an
automated image analysis pipeline (Figure 3C).
A major challenge of data analysis was to identify dying cells
aﬀected by cytotoxic samples. These cells diﬀer from healthy
cells since they are small and round, which prevents extraction
of a meaningful C/N ratio (C/N ratio very low), leading to
false-positive results. To improve the accuracy of the image
analysis pipeline used, cells aﬀected by cytotoxicity were
manually annotated based on their distinctive round shape.
These annotations then were used to train a random forest
model to recognize round cells and abnormally high mean
ﬂuorescence intensity to exclude them from analysis (Figure
3D).
To normalize plate-to-plate variations, the C/N ratio was
rescaled into the normalized percentage of inhibition (NPI) or
thez-score (the standard score). The NPI is the inhibition
relative to negative and positive controls, while thez-score is
the number of standard deviations a sample diﬀers from the
mean of all wells in the screening plate except of control wells.
Finally, an interactive web portal was developed to browse
original images and visualize their activity in a plate map. This
enabled a rapid visual quality control of the hits (Figures 3E
and S3, Supporting Information).
Library Screening. An in-house library of 2576 extracts
from 140 diﬀerent plant families and over 700 species was
screened.22 Given that the activity of two signaling pathways
(MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT) in two diﬀerent cell lines was
measured, four lists were generated. Extracts in these lists were
ranked according to thez-score or the NPI value. The
threshold for hits was established by a visual examination of
the 100 highest ranked extracts, except for AKT activity in
MM121224 cells, in which the 200 highest ranked extracts
were taken into consideration. In A2058 cells, the threshold (z-
score) for ERK activity was set empirically to−1.3 for ERK
activity and −1.9 for AKT activity (z-score). In MM121224
cells, the threshold (NPI) was set to 0.68 for ERK activity and
to 0.56 for AKT activity. This led to a total of 140 hits (Tables
S1−S4, Supporting Information).
A signiﬁcantly higher number of hits was observed for AKT
(121 in MM121224 cells and 35 in A2058 cells) than for ERK
activity (ﬁve hits with each cell line) (Figure 4). This suggests
that the PI3K/AKT pathway is more “druggable” than the
MAPK/ERK pathway. Recent studies have shown that the
MAPK pathway is wired to be robust against perturbations of
its components, possibly explaining why so few compounds
can lead to ERK inhibition in cells with aBRAF V600E
mutation. 28−30 A kinome siRNA screen performed on
MM121224 cells has also shown that a much smaller number
of kinases had an eﬀect on ERK versus AKT activity using the
same biosensor system.25 A signiﬁcantly higher number of
AKT hits was observed with MM121224 cells (121 hits) when
compared to A2058 cells (35 hits) (Figure 4C). This may be
explained by di ﬀerent mutations ( Figure S1 , Supporting
Information). In A2058 cells, a lack of PTEN lipid phosphatase
activity led to increased phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphos-
phate (PIP3) and, thus, increased PI3K/AKT signaling, while
in MM121224 cells, the presence of anNRAS Q61K mutation
led to Ras-dependent PI3K activation.PTEN deletions might
be more diﬃcult to target than anNRAS mutation since the
protein is absent. These results suggest strongly that diﬀerent
oncogenic mutations that converge on the same signaling
pathway (here AKT) will require inhibition of diﬀerent targets
of the signaling cascade using distinct sets of compounds. The
present screening strategy was well suited to accommodate this
need.
HPLC-Based Activity Pro ﬁling and Selection of
Extracts for Isolation. The extracts were selected for
microfractionation based on their potency in the HCS and
the taxonomic classiﬁcation of their corresponding plant
families. In this manner, a set of 44 extracts was submitted
to the HPLC-based activity proﬁling approach used routinely
in the laboratory. 22 Out of 44 extracts, 37 extracts still
displayed inhibition of the MAPK/ERK and/or PI3K/AKT
pathway when fractionated.
The selection of extracts for scale-up isolation was based on
the activity proﬁle obtained, the taxonomy of the plant family
or genus, a literature search (dereplication of peaks present in
active windows), and the availability of suﬃcient plant
material. The petroleum ether (PE)/EtOAc library extracts
from the plantsA. montana and P. nigrum showed promising
inhibition of ERK and/or AKT activity on both cell lines in the

primary screen, as well as promising activity in the micro-
fractions (Figure 7, Tables S1−S4, Figure S4, Supporting
Information). The library PE extract of A. montana roots
(AMR-LE) was the only hit showing ERK inhibition on both
cell lines. Moreover, the peaks present in the activity windows
of the activity proﬁle (Figure S4, Supporting Information) did
not correspond to any well-known secondary metabolite in this
species. This extract was therefore selected for scale-up work.
The extract of P. nigrum was of interest due to the activity
proﬁle obtained with the MM121224 cell line ( Figure 7).
Thus, it was therefore decided to further study this extract as
well.
Arnica montana. A scale-up EtOAc extract ofA. montana
roots (AMR-SU) was prepared from plant material purchased
in 2019. As shown inFigure S4(Supporting Information), the
HPLC chromatogram di ﬀered somewhat from the library
extract AMR-LE, and a new activity pro ﬁle of AMR-SU
therefore was generated based on activity data obtained with
the A2058 cell line (Figure 5). The preparative isolation of
these compounds was commenced 15 months later, in January
2021. At that time, the AMR-SU extract was analyzed again,
and after storage for 15 months at−20 °C, surprisingly the
extract composition had changed. Interestingly, the chromato-
gram of AMR-SU done in 2021 was similar again to the library
extract AMR-LE. Peaks corresponding to compounds5−7
were detected only in the extract that was freshly prepared and
were detected neither in the library extract AMR-LE nor in the
scale-up extract AMR-SU analyzed after 15 months (Figure S6,
Supporting Information). As both the library and the scale-up
extract were stored at−80 and −20 °C, respectively, this
suggested the degradation of 5−7 occurred even at low
temperatures. The activity proﬁle obtained with the AMR-SU
extract displayed two main active fractions, namely, f15 and f17
(Figure 5).
Compounds 1−7 were obtained as colorless, oily substances.
Their structures were identiﬁed based on the1H and 2D NMR
spectra as thymol derivatives 1−7.31−35 Electronic circular
dichroism (ECD) spectra and optical rotation data suggested
the presence of mixtures of enantiomers (Figures S21, S23,
S25, S27, S29 , Supporting Information). An attempt to
determine the enantiomeric access in natural epoxythymols
using a published BINOL methodology was not successful.36
Compounds 2, 5, 6, and7 have been reported previously from
the roots of A. montana, and 5−7 were only obtained as a
mixture.37
Migration of acyl moieties appears to be responsible for the
degradation of epoxides 5−7 to 2−4. Even though acyl
migration has not been reported in thymol derivatives, it has
been shown to occur in other natural products such as aescin

and coumarins. 38,39 A putative mechanism is proposed
(Scheme 1, Supporting Information).
While all compounds displayed micromolar activity on both
pathways, epoxides 5−7 showed slightly greater inhibition
potencies than 1−4 (Table 1 and Figures S31 −S34,
Supporting Information). Compound 5 showed the highest
activity on A2058 cells, with IC50 values of 11.8± 0.5 and 4.7
± 0.6 μM for AKT and ERK, respectively (Figure 6). The
PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition of all compounds was greater in
A2058 cells than in MM121224 cells. This was surprising since
PI3K/AKT signaling seems to be more druggable in
MM121224 than in A2058 cells, as discussed above.
Understanding the mechanism of action of these compounds
might therefore be of great interest to inhibit high PI3K/AKT
signaling in response to aPTEN deletion.
Thymol was recently shown to downregulate both PI3K/
AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, albeit with a long incubation
time (24 h) and very high concentrations (0.5−2 mM).40 In
contrast, the thymol derivatives obtained in the present
investigation inhibited the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathways already after 2 h. This suggests strongly that they
speciﬁcally inhibited oncogenic MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
activity.
To conﬁrm the results from the image-based HCS read-out,
immunostaining in MM121224 cells with anti-phospho-ERK
and -phospho-AKT on serine 473 antibodies was performed
with compounds1, 3,a n d 5 (Figure S35 ,S u p p o r t i n g
Information). Inhibition of AKT was con ﬁrmed, but,
unexpectedly, a concentration-dependent increase of phos-
pho-ERK levels was observed. An explanation for this
seemingly paradoxicalﬁnding may be that the phospho-ERK
antibody reveals the phosphorylation by the MAP2K MEK,
and thus ERK activation, while the ERK-KTR measures the
catalytic activity of ERK. As ERK exhibits negative feedback
regulation to MAP3K RAF and MAP2K MEK, a direct
inhibition of ERK catalytic activity might switch oﬀ the
negative feedback and, thereby, lead to increased Raf and MEK
activity and ERK phosphorylation (Figure S1, Supporting
Information).41 These results, therefore, suggest strongly that
the puriﬁed thymol derivatives directly target the catalytic

activity of ERK. As these compounds simultaneously target
both the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, an exact
understanding of their mode of action might allow these
scaﬀolds to be used as an inspiration for the development of
dual inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.
Piper nigrum. The HPLC activity proﬁle of the EtOAc
extract with MM121224 cells displayed a broad activity
window with f14 being the most active fraction (Figure 7).
However, the corresponding time window in the HPLC-UV
trace displayed several peaks, among them the dominant peak
of piperine (9). Therefore, an optimized separation by
semipreparative HPLC was used to enable a peak-based
fractionation of compounds.42 All peaks were collected as
fractions and tested in MM121224 cells ( Figure S38 ,
Supporting Information) at a concentration of 75 μg/mL.
Four of these displayed AKT activity (Figure S38, Table S7,
Supporting Information). Subsequently, a large scale-up
procedure was performed, which led to the isolation and
identiﬁcation of trichostachine (piperyline) ( 8),43,44 6,7-
dehydrobrachyamide B ( 10),44,45 (2Z,4E,6E)-piperettine
(11),46 and piperolein A (12).47 Piperine (9) was conﬁrmed
by comparison with an authentic reference.
Concentration responses indicated compound10 to be the
most potent piperamide active on both cell lines (Figures 8
and S51, Supporting Information). Visual examination indeed
conﬁrmed this compound to be most active on AKT in
MM121224. A clear IC50 could not be determined, as the
plateau was not reached at 200μM. However, a visual control
suggests compound 10 to be cytotoxic for A2058 cells, which
explains the violin shapes observed for AKT and ERK activity
at 200 μM.
Piperamides 8, 11, and12 inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway
at 200μM only in the MM121224 cell line. Piperine (9) only
inhibited AKT to some extent on this cell line and thus was the
least active compound (Figure S53, Supporting Information).
Interestingly, piperine has been shown to decrease phosphory-
lated ERK and AKT in diﬀerent cancer cells, in a similar
concentration range to that used in the present experiments
(150−160 μM), but with signiﬁcantly longer exposure.48,49 In
both cell lines, piperolein A ( 12) displayed weak ERK
inhibition at 200 μM. Compounds 8 and 9 were not active
on the ERK biosensor (Figure S52, Supporting Information).
The piperamide 11 was only active against MAPK/ERK in
MM121224 cells.
The activity measured by the biosensor was conﬁrmed by
immunostaining experiments in MM121224 cells for phos-
phorylated ERK and AKT (Figure S54, Supporting Informa-
tion). Cells treated with compound 10 showed a concen-
tration-dependent decrease in phosphorylated AKT and
phosphorylated ERK at 200μM, while compounds 11 and
12 showed only a marginal or no eﬀect for the two kinases.
■ CONCLUSIONS

throughput mode HCS is potentially applicable to other targets
of the kinome. In the present case, compounds targeting
speciﬁc pathological MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling
states induced by di ﬀerent melanoma-relevant oncogenic
mutations were identi ﬁed. This approach measuring the
activity of downstream proteins in signaling pathways has the
potential to discover a diverse set of compounds that inhibit
various upstream targets. With the advent of personalized
medicine, it may be envisioned that once the genome of a
patient tumor has been sequenced, speciﬁc compounds will be
administered to the patient that will target the aberrant state
depending on the speciﬁc oncogenic mutations.
Provided herein is a complementary and more targeted
approach for the discovery of natural products with potential
anticancer activity, as compared to standard approaches where
cell survival, proliferation, or cytotoxicity is measured.50−52 An
important technical challenge was the cytotoxicity of extracts
aﬀecting cell morphology and, as a consequence, preventing
measurement of meaningful ERK/AKT activities from
biosensor images. For that purpose, a machine learning
algorithm was developed to identify and exclude cells with
altered morphology. This illustrates the challenges of image-
based measurements of protein activity in HCS settings.
Compounds targeting ERK/AKT activity may be overlooked if
they are toxic at high concentrations or if they are present in
extracts containing cytotoxic compounds.
The potential of the pipeline used is exempliﬁed by the
isolation of bioactive thymol derivatives fromA. montana and
piperamides from P. nigrum . However, the challenge of
identifying the molecular target and the mechanism of action
of active compounds remains. Promising approaches to address
these issues include thermal proteome proﬁling, as well as
protein and kinase microarrays.53,54 While the most potent
thymol derivative was active on both pathways at low
micromolar concentrations, the piperamides showed only
weak activity after isolation. This example illustrates the
remaining challenge of selecting the most promising plants for
scale-up isolation, given that the concentration of active
compounds in an extract is unknown at that stage.
In summary, a proof of concept is provided of a scalable
natural product screening and discovery pipeline to explore
comprehensively the chemical space of extract libraries against
the two key oncogenic pathways in melanoma. It is envisioned
that this pipeline can be adapted to other molecular pathways
and pathological conditions.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were
measured in MeOH (1 mg/mL) on a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter
(Brechbü hler AG, Switzerland) equipped with a 10 cm temperature-
controlled microcell. ECD and UV spectra were recorded in MeOH
(16.6−333.3 μg/mL) on a Chirascan CD spectrometer using 1 mm
path precision cells (110 QS, Hellma Analytics). NMR spectra were
recorded at 23 °C on a Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer
operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C and
equipped either with a 1 mm TXI microprobe or a 5 mm BBO probe.
Spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), methanol-
d4, or DMSO-d6 (both Armar Chemicals) and analyzed by Bruker
TopSpin 3.5 and ACD/Laboratories NMR Workbook suite software.
Chemical shifts are reported asδ values (ppm), with residual solvent
signal as internal reference,J in Hz.
HPLC-grade solvents (Scharlau/Reuss Chemie/Macron) and
ultrapure water from a Milli-Q water puri ﬁcation system (Merck
Millipore) were used for analytical and semipreparative HPLC
separations. HPLC-grade formic acid (FA), DMSO, and solvents were
obtained from Scharlau or Macron Fine Chemicals. For extraction
and preparative separation, technical-grade solvents were used after
distillation. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was performed using
a ASE 200 extractor (Dionex). Normal-phaseﬂash chromatography
was carried out on a Puriﬂash 4100 (Interchim) or on a Sepacore
system (Bü chi), both consisting of a pump, UV detector, and fraction
collector. Silica gel 60 (15−40 μm to pack column; 63−200 μm for
dry loads of samples) was obtained from Merck. Preparative HPLC
separations were carried out on a 1290 Inﬁnity II Preparative LC/MS
system (Agilent Technologies) consisting of a binary pump (1260
Prep Bin pump, 1290 Inﬁnity II) connected to a PDA detector (1100
Series). Data acquisition and processing were performed with
Chemstation (Agilent Technologies). A SunFire Prep C 18 OBD
column (5μm, 30× 150 mm i.d., Waters) equipped with a C18 Prep
guard column (10× 30 mm i.d.) was used at aﬂow rate of 20 mL/
min.
Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was performed on an
Armen Spot centrifugal partition chromatography instrument
(AlphaCrom) equipped with a ProStar 210 pump, a ProStar 325
UV/vis detector, and a ProStar 704 fraction collector (all Varian).
Semipreparative HPLC was carried out on an HP 1100 Series system
(Agilent Technologies) consisting of a binary pump, auto sampler,
and diode array detector. Data acquisition and processing were
performed using ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies).
Semipreparative peak-based fractionation was performed with an
Alliance 2690 HPLC system (Waters) equipped with a 996 diode
array detector (Waters). Data acquisition and processing were
performed using Empower software. The following columns were
used: SunFire Prep C18 column (5 μm, 10 × 150 mm i.d., Waters)
equipped with a guard column (10× 10 mm i.d.), Xbridge Prep C18
(5 μm, 10× 150 mm i.d., Waters) with a guard column (5μm, 10×
10 mm i.d.), Biphenyl Prep column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm i.d.,
Kinetex).
HPLC-PDA-ELSD-ESIMS analyses were performed on an LC-MS
8030 system (Shimadzu) consisting of a degasser, binary high-
pressure mixing pump, autosampler, column oven, and PDA detector.
A triple quadrupole MS (LCMS-8030, Shimadzu) and an ELSD 3300
detector (Alltech) were connected via a T-splitter to the system. A
SunFire C18 column (3.5 μm, 3 × 150 mm i.d., Waters) equipped
with a C18 guard column (10× 3 mm i.d.) was used at aﬂow rate of
0.4 mL/min.
TLC was performed on silica gel 60 F254 coated aluminum TLC
plates (Merck). Detection was at UV 254 and 366 nm and after
spraying with 1% ethanolic vanillin and 10% sulfuric acid in EtOH,
followed by heating (10 min; 110°C).
Plant Material.Roots ofArnica montanaL. (Arnicae Radix) were
purchased from Dixa AG (Switzerland) in two batches (lot nos.
181041 and 200968). A voucher specimen (1170) of lot no. 181041 is
deposited at the Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of
Basel.
The dried fruits ofPiper nigrum L. (Piperis Nigri Fructus) (lot no.
2008.04.0376) were purchased from Hä nseler AG (Switzerland). A
voucher specimen (no. 427) is deposited at the Institute of
Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Basel.
Microfractionation and Activity Proﬁles. Microfractionation of
the extracts was performed on an LC-MS 8030 system (Shimadzu)
connected with an FC 204 fraction collector (Gilson). Extracts (10
mg/mL DMSO) were loaded in two portions (2 × 30 μL,
corresponding to 0.6 mg of extract) on the analytical HPLC system.
The separation was performed for 3 min at 10% CH3CN, followed by
a linear gradient to 100% CH3CN over 27 min, and aﬁnal hold at
100% CH3CN. The mobile phase contained 0.1% FA. A total of 24
microfractions of 1.5 min each (from 2 to 38 min) were collected into
a 96-deepwell plate. Plates were dried overnight at 37°C in an EZ-2
vacuum evaporator (Genevac). Dried residues were redissolved in
DMSO and tested in the HCS assay.
Finally, one analytical HPLC trace was combined with the activity
of fractions in R to generate the so-called HPLC time-based activity
proﬁles.

Extraction and Isolation (Arnica montana). The material (lot
no. 181041, 500 g) was ground and mixed with sea sand (2:1) prior
to percolation. Extraction with 2.5 L of EtOAc aﬀorded 12.4 g of
dried extract.
The EtOAc extract was fractionated byﬂash chromatography on a
silica column (45× 7 cm). The sample was introduced as a dry load
(12.4 g of extract absorbed on 36 g of silica gel). Elution was
performed with a gradient of EtOAc in hexane [0% EtOAc (0−10
min), 0% → 5% (10−120 min), 5% → 20% (120−165 min), 20%
(180 min), 20%→ 100% (180−360 min) at aﬂow rate of 30 mL/
min]. The column was further eluted with a gradient of MeOH in
EtOAc [0→ 50% (360−390 min), 50% (390−420 min) at aﬂow rate
of 30 mL/min]. Fractions (22 mL) were pooled to 11 main fractions
(A−K) based on their TLC pattern.
Fraction H (1500 mg, 750 mg/mL THF) was submitted to
preparative RP-HPLC with 50% CH3CN (ﬂow rate 20 mL/min) to
aﬀord two major fractions, H_B (449 mg,tR 25 min) and H_D (65
mg, tR 38 min). H_B (32 mg) was separated on a semipreparative RP-
HPLC (XBridge C18) with 35% CH3CN (ﬂow rate 4 mL/min) to
aﬀord compound2 (12.3 mg,tR 36 min). Fraction H_D (19 mg) was
submitted to semipreparative RP-HPLC (Kinetex biphenyl) with 32%
CH3CN (ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min) to aﬀord compounds3 (4.4 mg,tR
75 min) and4 (3.3 mg, tR 80 min).
Fraction F (836 mg) was further fractionated on an open silica gel
column (15 × 4 cm i.d.) using a step gradient of EtOAc−hexane
[2:98 (2 L), 5:95 (1.7 L), 10:90 (1 L), 20:80 (0.5 L), 100:0 (0.6 L)].
Fractions (15 mL) were pooled to 21 main fractions (F_A−F_U)
based on their TLC pattern. F_Q (53 mg) was submitted to
semipreparative RP-HPLC (Sunﬁre C18 column) with 62% CH3CN
(containing 0.1% FA;ﬂow rate of 4 mL/min) to aﬀord compounds6
(3.8 mg, tR 63 min) and7 (5.6 mg, tR 68 min).
Fraction I (875 mg) was submitted to preparative RP-HPLC with a
gradient method (15−100% CH3CN in 30 min) to yield fraction I_B
(57 mg, tR 18 min). Fraction I_B (11 mg) was submitted to
semipreparative RP-HPLC (Sunﬁre C18 column) with 22% CH3CN
(ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min) to aﬀord compound1 (9.7 mg,tR 16 min).
Ground material of lot no. 200968 (1000 g) was mixed with sea
sand (2:1) for percolation. Extraction with 5 L of petroleum ether
(PE) aﬀorded 23.1 g of PE extract, and further extraction with 4 L of
EtOAc yielded 7 g of EtOAc extract.
The PE extract of lot no. 200968 was fractionated by ﬂash
chromatography on a silica column (45× 7 cm i.d.) with a Bü chi
Sepacore system. The sample was introduced as a dry load (23 g of
extract absorbed on 60 g of silica gel). Elution was performed with a
gradient of EtOAc in hexane [2% (0−45 min), 2%→ 10% (45−120
min), 10% (120−205 min), 10%→ 20% (205−265 min), 20%→ 0%
(265−505 min) at a ﬂow rate of 30 mL/min]. The column was
further eluted with MeOH in EtOAc [0%→ 100% (505−535 min),
100% (535−545 min) at aﬂow rate of 30 mL/min]. Fractions (30
mL) were pooled to 25 main fractions (A−Y) based on their TLC
pattern.
Fraction I (15 mg) was submitted to semipreparative RP-HPLC
(Sunﬁre C18 column) with 35% CH3CN (ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min) to
aﬀord compound 5 (5 mg, tR 44 min).
Extraction and Isolation (Piper nigrum). An aliquot (11.9 g) of
ground fruits was extracted consecutively by ASE with dichloro-
methane and EtOAc (three extraction cycles each at 120 bar and 70
°C). The EtOAc extract aﬀorded 94 mg of material. A peak-based
collection of the extract (100 mg/mL DMSO) was done based on a
previously reported method (Figure S38, Supporting Information).42
The remaining part of the plant material (484 g) was mixed with sea
sand for percolation. Extraction with 2 L of hexane aﬀorded 10.6 g of
dried extract, and a further extraction with EtOAc yielded 20.4 g of
extract.
The EtOAc extract was separated on an open column with silica gel
(63−200 μm, 55 × 6.5 cm i.d.), using a step gradient of PE−EtOAc
(95:5, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 (each step 2 L), 50:50 (1 L), 40:60,
20:80, 0:100 (each step 2 L)). Fractions (220 mL) were pooled to 23
main fractions (F1−23) based on their TLC pattern. F15 (454 mg)
and F16 (473 mg) were separated by CPC, utilizing a solvent system
consisting of hexane−EtOAc−MeOH−H2O (4:3:4:3). The pump
was set to aﬂow rate of 5 mL/min and the rotor at 2000 rpm (333g).
The instrument was run in the descending mode. Fractions were
collected every 1.5 min for 70 min. The F15 fractions were pooled to
nine (F15a−F15i) and F16 to ﬁve (F16a−F16e) main fractions,
according to their UV absorbances.
Semipreparative RP-HPLC was used to further purify the following
fractions with a Sunﬁre C18 column (ﬂow rate 4 mL/min; 0.1% FA
was added in all mobile phases, except for F16e). F15e (64 mg), F16e
(94 mg), and a portion of F22 (2 g) were separated with 45%
CH3CN, 50% CH3CN, and 40% CH3CN, respectively, to obtain11
(21 mg; tR 32.5 min), 12 (31 mg, tR 35.2), and 8 (9.5 mg; tR 14.1
min). F21 (177 mg) was separated with a gradient of 40% to 85%
CH3CN over 30 min to obtain10 (16 mg,tR 20.4 min). Piperine (9)
was identiﬁed with a reference substance (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck).

ECD Computational Methods. Conformational analysis was
performed with Schrö dinger MacroModel 11.0 (Schrö dinger, LLC,
New York, USA) employing the OPLS2005 (optimized potential for
liquid simulations) forceﬁeld in H2O for geometrical optimization in
two steps. In the ﬁrst step, a global minimum was searched using
30 000 steps. In the second step, the global minimum was used for a
conformational search (10 000−30 000 steps), and the ﬁve con-
formers with the lowest energy were subjected to geometrical
optimization and energy calculation using density functional theory
(DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, using the SCRF
method and the CPMC model for solvation in MeOH with the
Gaussian 09 program package. 55 Excitation energy (denoted by
wavelength in nm), rotator strength (Rstr), dipole velocity (Rvel), and
dipole length (Rlen) were calculated in MeOH by TD-DFT (B3LYP/
6-31G(d,p)). ECD curves were obtained on the basis of rotator
strengths with a half-band of 0.25 eV using SpecDis v1.71.
High-Content Assay. Cells (100 μL) were seeded on 96-well
black/clear ﬂat-bottom plates (Falcon) at a density of 5000 cells/well

(A2058) and 4500 cells/well (MM121224), respectively. Cells were
treated with samples 1 day after reseeding.
Sample Preparation. Samples to be tested were prepared for cell
treatment as follows: Extracts (10 mg/mL in DMSO) were applied at
a ﬁnal concentration of 75μg/mL. Microfractions (dry residues) were
dissolved in either 5 or 10μL of DMSO. The plates were shaken for
30 min at 500 rpm on a plate shaker (MixMate, Eppendorf).
Complete RPMI medium was added to each fraction to obtain a
DMSO concentration of 7.5%, and plates were shaken another 10
min. Finally, samples (10 μL) were added to each well. Isolated
compounds were tested at eight diﬀerent concentrations starting at
200 μM to 1.56μM.
Cell Treatment with Samples. Extracts, fractions, and pure
compounds were warmed in an incubator for 10 min prior to
treatment. After application of treatment, plates were gently shaken
manually for 1 min. Cells were incubated for 2 h, thenﬁxed with PFA
4% [Sigma-Aldrich/Merck (36% PFA diluted with PBS)] for 10 min.
MM121224 cells were washed three times with DPBS (Dutscher).
A2058 cells were washed twice and stained with DAPI (1% in PBS)
for 5 min followed by a third washing step.
The extract screen was performed in duplicate, with testing of pure
compounds done in duplicate forP. nigrum and in triplicate forA.
montana. For microfractions only single experiments were performed.
Positive controls for A2058 cells were 20 μM AZD5363
(Selleckchem) as AKT inhibitor and 500 nM cobimetinib (Sell-
eckchem) as ERK pathway inhibitor. For MM121224 cells, 200 nM
cobimetinib as ERK pathway inhibitor and 1μM GDC0941
(Selleckchem) as AKT pathway inhibitor were used. The negative
control was 0.75% DMSO in complete medium.
Cell Lines and Cell Culture.A2058 cells (ATTC-CRL-11147)
were cultured in DMEM growth medium (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Good Forte by
PAN Biotech), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and 2%
glutamine (Biowest). Patient-derived MM121224 cells 26 were
cultured in RPMI growth medium (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), 10%
FBS (Good Forte by PAN Biotech), 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(ThermoFisher), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck).
Both cell lines were incubated in humidiﬁed air at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Cells were passaged at 70 −80% conﬂuence using trypsin-EDTA
(Sigma). Passage numbers used were 20−40 for A2058 and 17−28
for MM121224. The cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma
contamination with MycoAlert (Lonza).
Plasmids. A2058 cells were transfected to stably express H2B-
miRFP703, ERK-KTR-mScarlet, and FoxO3a-KTR-mNeonGreen.
MM121224 cells were transfected to stably express H2B-mTurquoise,
ERK-KTR-mScarlet, and FoxO3a-KTR-mNeonGreen. Both cell lines
were generated by transfection with FuGENE (Promega) according
to the manufacturer ’s protocol and antibiotic selection with
blasticidin, hygromycin, and puromycin, respectively. As previously
described, the H2B-miRFP703 a nd H2B-mTurquoiose nuclear
markers were constructed by fusing the coding sequences (CDS) of
human H2B clustered histone 11 (H2BC11) with the ﬂuorescent
protein miRFP703 and mTurquoise CDS, respectively.56 The nuclear
marker was then cloned into PiggyBac plasmid pPBbSr2-MCS. ERK-
KTR-mScarlet was constructed by fusing ERK-KTR CDS57 with the
ﬂuorescent protein mScarlet CDS and cloning it into the PiggyBac
plasmid pBr-HPB. FoxO3a-KTR (AKT-KTR) was generated by
fusing the 1-1188 portion of theHomo sapiens forkhead box O3 a
(FoxO3a) CDS with theﬂuorescent protein mNeonGreen CDS and
cloned into PiggyBac plasmid pSB-HPB. The Super Piggybac
transposase expression vector was used for cotransfection with the
PiggyBac plasmids in order to facilitate integration at TTAA sites.58
Immunostaining. Wild-type MM121224 cells wereﬁxed in 4%
PFA and washed 3× 5 min with PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 20
min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PanReac AppliChem ITW Reagents) in
PBS and washed 3× 5 min with PBS. Blocking was performed with
2% BSA and 22.52 mg/mL glycine in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20)
for 40 min and washed once with PBS; then cells were incubated with
primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-MAP kinase, activated (diphos-
phorylated ERK-1&2, Sigma-Aldrich; Phospho-Akt (Ser473), Cell
Signaling Technology) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST
overnight at 4°C. The day after, cells were washed 3× 5 min with
PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa 546 goat anti-
mouse and Alexa 546 goat anti-mouse; both Life Technolgies/
ThermoFisher) in 0.1% BSA in PBST for 1 h at room temperature.
Cells were washed 3× 5 min, counterstained with DAPI for 5 min,
and washed two times with PBS. Cells were then imaged.
Imaging. All imaging experiments except immunostainings were
performed on an Operetta HCS microscope (wideﬁeld and spinning
disk, xenon arc lamp 200 W) equipped with a CCD camera and a
plate handler robot. Images were acquired using a 10× LWD objective
(NA: 0.3; working distance 10 mm). Acquisition channels were set as
follows: mScarlett (ERK-KTR) 560−580 nm (excitation), 590−640
nm (emission); neongreen (AKT-KTR) 490−510 nm (excitation),
520−560 nm (emission); mTurquoise (H2B) 410 −430 nm
(excitation), 460 −500 nm (emission); DAPI: 360 −400 nm
(excitation), 410−480 nm (emission). For each well 15 images
(ﬁelds of view) per channel were acquired.
Immunostaining experiments were imaged with an Eclipse Ti
inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon) run by NIS-Elements
(Nikon) and equipped with a Plan Apo air 20× (NA 0.8) and an
Andor Zyla 4.2 plus camera (16-bit depth images). Focus drift was
prevented by the Perfect Focus System (Nikon). The optical
conﬁgurations of the acquisition channels were the following (all
ﬁlters from Chroma): Alexa 546: 555 nm, ET605/52m; Alexa488:
470 nm, ET525/36m; DAPI: 410 nm, ET460/50m.
Image Analysis. Images were processed with CellProﬁler 2.3.1
software (Broad Institute). The threshold-based segmentation
algorithm identiﬁed nuclei in the mTurquoise/DAPI channel. To
measure ﬂuorescence intensity in the nucleus, the nuclear mask was
reduced by two pixels to exclude blurred edges of the nucleus. To
measure ﬂuorescence intensity in the cytosol, a ring was created
around the nucleus. First, the nuclear mask was expanded by
maximum 15 pixels by thresholding the sum of ERK and AKT
channels. Then, this new mask was subtracted from the nuclear mask
expanded by two pixels to exclude blurred edges of the nucleus. The
resulting ring was used to measureﬂuorescence in the cytosol. Single-
cell ERK and AKT activity was estimated by taking the ratio of the
cytosolic and nuclear mean ﬂuorescence intensities (i.e., the C/N
ratio). The shape features of individual cells were calculated from a
whole-cell segmentation (nuclear mask expanded by a maximum 100
pixels) on the sum of ERK and AKT channels.
Data Analysis. The data were processed with custom scripts
written in R programming language. Cells dying due to cytotoxicity
gave rise to false positive hits and thus became the main target of the
ﬁltering step. To remove them from the analysis, a random-forest
model implemented in the H2O.ai machine-learning framework was
trained. The models were trained to separate healthy from dying cells
based onﬂuorescence intensity and shape features of single cells. The
prediction accuracy was 98% for the model trained on the A2058 cell
line and 94% for the MM121224 model. Additionally, (i) cells with
C/N ratios greater than 5, (ii)ﬁelds of view with less than 15% living
cells, and (iii) wells with less thanﬁve viableﬁelds of view or with less
than 200 living cells were discarded.
Plates were normalized by calculating normalized percentage
inhibition and z-score. The NPI rescales the C/N ratio between the
means of the negative and positive controls. For this purpose, it was
assumed that NPI = 1 corresponds to the negative and NPI = 0 to the
positive control. Thez-score is the number of standard deviations a
sample is away from the plate mean (excluding the control wells).
Z′ was calculated to assess plate quality. This value quantiﬁes the
distance between the distributions of negative and positive controls.59
Z′ = 1 is the theoretical limit for an ideal screen with no variability in
controls or the dynamic range reaching inﬁnity. AZ′ between 0.5 and
1 corresponds to a plate with a large separation band between
controls. The screen typically achieved aZ′ between 0.55 and 0.92.
Data Visualization. An interactive web application, dzPlate-
Viewer, was developed to quickly browse raw images from the entire
plate and the accompanying quantiﬁcation. Users were able to switch
between the channels (e.g., nuclear, ERK, AKT), adjust image
