Abstract
The cyclical protrusion and retraction of the leading edge is a hallmark of many migrating cells 
involved in processes such as development, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. The molecular 
identity of signaling mechanisms that control these cycles has remained unknown. Here, we used 
live cell imaging of biosensors to monitor spontaneous morphodynamic and signaling activities, 
and employed correlative image analysis to examine the role of cAMP-activated Protein Kinase A 
(PKA) in protrusion regulation. PKA activity at the leading edge is closely synchronized with 
rapid protrusion and with the activity of RhoA. Ensuing PKA phosphorylation of RhoA and the 
resulting increased interaction between RhoA and RhoGDI establishes a negative feedback that 
controls the cycling of RhoA activity at the leading edge. Thus, cooperation between PKA, RhoA, 
and a RhoGDI forms a pacemaker that governs the morphodynamic behavior of migrating cells.

involved in the formation of cell protrusion such as actin assembly and adhesions exhibit a 
similar cyclic behavior1,3–5; however, the molecular identity of the pacemakers of 
protrusion-retraction cycles and the signaling pathways that govern their frequency remain 
obscure.
Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a kinase that regulates diverse cellular 
activities, is activated at the leading edge of some cell types migrating in vitro6,7, and 
inhibition of PKA inhibits cell migration8–11. PKA regulates axonal guidance in vivo12, 
morphogenetic movements in Xenopus13, and mutations of a PKA phosphorylation site in 
doublecortin is associated with X-linked lissencephaly, a neuronal migration defect in 
humans14. Furthermore, PKA facilitates the formation of peripheral ruffles15,16 and 
influences protrusions at the leading edge of migrating CHO and smooth muscle cells6,17. 
PKA activity in the cell is compartmentalized; therefore information about spatiotemporal 
patterning of PKA activity is needed to understand the role of PKA in specific elements of 
cell migration and to identify relevant PKA substrates.
Here, we used live cell imaging of biosensors to monitor the spontaneous morphodynamic 
and signaling activities of renal epithelial PtK1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells and employed correlative image analysis to examine the role of PKA in protrusion 
regulation with second-scale temporal and micron-scale spatial resolution. PKA inhibition 
led to reduced frequency of formation of protrusions of increased duration that propagated 
transversely along the cell edge. Furthermore, PKA activity at the leading edge exhibited 
close temporal and spatial correlation with the formation of protrusions and the activation of 
RhoA. This correlation depended on the phosphorylation of RhoA(Ser 188) by PKA, an 
event known to facilitate RhoA binding to RhoGDI 18, which leads to displacement of RhoA 
from the plasma membrane and precludes RhoA from interactions with downstream 
effectors19–21. Increased RhoGDI expression completely reversed the effects of PKA 
inhibition on protrusion morphodynamics, thus establishing that PKA governs the timing of 
protrusions by phosphorylation of RhoA resulting in RhoGDI-mediated termination of 
RhoA activity at the leading edge; hence the interaction of these three elements defines a 
pacemaker of the protrusion-retraction cycle. In consequence our studies provide direct 
mechanistic insight into how PKA, RhoA, and RhoGDI cooperate to control events at the 
leading edge of migrating cells.
Results
PKA controls protrusive duration, magnitude, and transverse propagation
To examine the effects of PKA activation at the leading edge of migrating cells on 
morphodynamic behaviors, we blocked PKA activity with a pseudosubstrate peptide, 
PKI22,23 by transfecting PtK1 cells with cDNAs encoding PKI and enabled computer vision 
tracking of the membrane dynamics of the leading edge2 with a membrane-localized GFP-
CAAX (Fig.1a). We noted dramatically increased protrusion magnitude in PKI-expressing 
cells (Fig.1b; Movies 1, 2). To quantify these effects, we divided the cell edge into segments 
and followed their frame-to-frame displacements over time (SFigure 1)2. We then pasted the 
edge velocity values in each segment at one time-point of the movie into the column of a 
matrix and repeated the procedure time-point-by-time point over the entire movie. This

resulted in a cell-shape independent representation of protrusion and retraction dynamics as 
a morphodynamic map. Velocity values were color-coded from −50 nm/sec retraction (blue) 
to 50nm/sec protrusion (red) (Fig.1c). Confirming previous analyses of PtK1 cells 2, control 
cells revealed quasi-cyclical protrusion and retraction events for each segment of the cell 
edge. Importantly, the spatial autocorrelation of the protrusion and retraction activity along 
the cell edge had a full width at half maximum of 4.9 µm, [CI ±1.0] indicating that 
protrusion and retraction alternate on a length scale of single microns (see Methods).
As reported before 2, the transitions from retraction to protrusion propagated transversely 
along the cell edge, as indicated by a slanted streak of high forward velocity (arrow, Fig.1c). 
PKI transfection dramatically altered these dynamics. Over 50 min., much fewer protrusion-
retraction cycles of much greater duration were observed (Fig.1c middle panel). 
Furthermore, PKA inhibition led to a more pronounced transversal protrusion propagation 
(arrow, Fig.1c middle panel). Representative segment edge velocity over time in a control or 
PKI-transfected cell is plotted in Fig.1c lower panel. Temporal auto-correlation function of 
the edge movement, averaged over all segments of the cell edge showed that inhibition of 
PKA activity prolonged the cycles from 130 to 820 sec (Fig.1d). Comparison of multiple 
cells (SFigure 1) confirmed a systematic, statistically significant increase of the cycle time 
[control (n=7) = 122±5.2(SEM) sec, and PKI (n=9) = 668±100.7 sec, P=0.0002]. Inhibition 
of PKA activity by 1µM KT-5720 or mislocalization of PKA by expression of 
mitochondrially-targeted AKAP peptide that binds all PKA (dual-AKAP trap) 24 resulted in 
protrusion morphodynamics similar to those observed with PKI transfection (SFigure2). 
These findings indicate that PKA regulates morphodynamics, controlling magnitude, 
duration, and transverse propagation of protrusions.
Temporal correlation of PKA activity with protrusion
We examined temporal and spatial correlations of PKA activity with protrusion using a 
membrane-bound FRET-based PKA biosensor (pmAKAR3) (SFigure3)25. CFP fluorescence 
tracked the leading edge (Fig.2a left) and YFP/CFP fluorescent emissions were analyzed by 
a MATLAB® program that corrects for dark current, variations in excitation light intensities, 
uneven field illumination, background autofluorescence, and rates of donor and acceptor 
photobleaching (see Methods) to calculate PKA activity FRET ratios (Fig.2a right). 
Protrusion velocity and FRET signals at different distances from the cell edge were collected 
(Fig.2b).
PKA activity within 1µm of the leading edge (Fig.2c) varied with a similar periodicity to 
protrusion-retraction (Fig.2d). Because the biosensor is a PKA substrate, at high expression 
levels, it could be a dominant-negative suppressor of PKA signaling. Accordingly, we 
selected cells with modest biosensor expression and verified that the duration of protrusion-
retraction cycles was not altered(Fig.2e).
Temporal cross-correlations between FRET and edge velocity at different time lags were 
obtained in each sampling window (Fig.2b) by computing the Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient between the collected time series. Mean correlation functions of the entire 
leading edge of the cell were obtained by averaging the correlation coefficient over all 
sampling windows for each temporal lag. Of note, averaging at the level of the correlation

coefficients permitted us to extract robust relationships between signaling and cell edge 
movement despite the spatially heterogeneous protrusion and retraction states of an 
individual cell. Integrating the data from 3 cells, we found a significant (P<0.0001) temporal 
cross-correlation of cell edge protrusions with PKA activity within 1µm from the cell edge 
(Fig.2f). The location of the cross-correlation maximum indicated a time shift of 22 sec, [CI 
±13](CI - 95% Confidence Interval) between the peaks of PKA activity and protrusion 
velocity (Fig.2f), i.e. maximum activity is slightly delayed relative to fastest edge 
advancement. In primary Endothelial Cells peak PKA activity also slightly trailed maximal 
protrusion velocities (SFigure 3). PKA activity measured up to 4 µm from the cell edge 
maintained this temporal cross-correlation (Fig.2f). FRET data generated by a PKA-
insensitive mutant biosensor generated insignificant, random correlation values at any time 
shift (SFigure 3). The tight temporal cross-correlation between PKA activity and edge 
movement suggested that they are causally-linked.
PKA Phosphorylation Regulates the Dynamics of RhoA Activation
We next sought PKA substrates that account for its linkage to morphodynamics. RhoA is a 
PKA substrate18 and RhoA activity at the leading edge synchronizes with cell protrusion26. 
We used a single chain, RhoA biosensor to measure the RhoA activity27 and we selected 
cells with moderate expression of the biosensor in which the timing of protrusions was 
similar to non-transfected cells (see Fig.3c). However, all cells that expressed the RhoA 
biosensor exhibited prolonged and less periodic protrusions (not shown). Modest expression 
biosensor of different design28 did not affect morphodynamics and was used in all 
experiments reported here. These two biosensors differ in their mechanism of targeting 
plasma membrane; specifically the second biosensor contains the authentic RhoA C-
terminus, thereby preserving its PKA phosphorylation and RhoGDI binding sites. These 
differences suggested the role of RhoA/RhoGDI interaction in control of protrusion 
morphodynamics by PKA phosphorylation of RhoA. All protrusion velocity and activity 
maps used for the analyses described below are in SFigure 4.
Temporal cross-correlation of RhoA activities and protrusion within 0.4 µm of the cell edge 
resembled the cross-correlation between PKA and protrusion (Fig.3a). This finding 
suggested that PKA and RhoA activities are causally-linked. Indeed, PKA phosphorylation 
of RhoA(Ser188) increases RhoA’s affinity for RhoGDI reducing RhoA activity in part by 
sequestration from the membrane18. We therefore created a PKA-resistant RhoA(S188A) 
reporter and expressed at levels that did not alter the timing of protrusions (Fig.3c). As 
expected, activation of PKA resulted in increased binding of RhoGDI to RhoA but not 
RhoA(S188A) reporters (SFigure 4f). The activity of RhoA(S188A) exhibited a dramatically 
altered relationship with protrusions (Fig.3a). The most prominent feature of the cross-
correlation between protrusion and the RhoA(S188A) activity was a negative peak 40 sec 
after peak velocity of protrusions (Fig.3a). Thus, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RhoA at 
Ser 188 regulates the timing of RhoA activation at the leading edge.
As noted above, phosphorylation of RhoA increases its affinity for RhoGDI, leading us to 
suspect that mistiming of RhoA(S188A) activation was due to reduced affinity for RhoGDI. 
To test this idea, we over-expressed RhoGDI in cells expressing RhoA or RhoA(S188A)

activity reporters. In RhoGDI over-expressing cells, peaks of activities of wild type RhoA 
and RhoA(S188A) mutant occurred ∼30 sec before protrusions reached maximal velocities 
(Fig.3b). We ascribe this leftward shift in the temporal correlation of RhoA and protrusive 
activity to early termination of RhoA signaling at the plasma membrane in RhoGDI-over 
expressing cells. Early termination of RhoA activity by over-expression of RhoGDI reduced 
the average duration of protrusion cycle from 122 sec, [CI ±5.2] to 92 sec, [CI ±6.5]. Thus, 
inhibition of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RhoA alters the relationship between 
protrusions and RhoA activity by reducing the affinity of RhoA for RhoGDI, whereas over-
expression of RhoGDI compensates for this reduced affinity.
Over-expression of RhoA(S188A) or RhoA phenocopies the effects of PKA inhibition on 
protrusion dynamics
As noted above, inhibition of PKA resulted in increased duration, magnitude, and transverse 
propagation of protrusions. We hypothesized that this was due to the loss of RhoA 
phosphorylation, resulting in prolonged and elevated RhoA signaling at the plasma 
membrane. To test this idea, we over-expressed RhoA(S188A) which resulted in 
morphodynamics resembling those observed with inhibition of PKA, i.e. these cells showed 
a marked reduction in the frequency and an increase in the duration and transverse 
propagation of protrusions (Fig.4; SFigure 5). Moreover, this phenotype was due to reduced 
regulation by RhoGDI, because co-expression of RhoGDI with RhoA(S188A) resulted in 
reversal of all the temporal effects of RhoA(S188A) expression, including shortening of 
duration and reduction in transverse propagation of protrusions (Fig.4; SFigure 5). The 
increased amplitude of protrusions and retractions remaining after co-expression of RhoGDI 
and RhoA(S188A) is ascribed to an overall increase in RhoA. Over-expression of wild type 
RhoA with and without RhoGDI resulted in cell phenotypes similar to the described above 
for RhoA(S188A) with and without RhoGDI (SFigure 6) confirming the importance of the 
ratio of RhoA/RhoGDI in the timing of protrusions.
The foregoing data suggested that the interaction of RhoA with RhoGDI led to the 
termination of protrusions. A recent study reported that, in some cells, over-expression of 
Rho GTPases results in degradation of endogenous RhoGTPases due to competition for 
RhoGDIs29. We did not observe a reduction in protein levels of Rac1 or CDC42 in cells 
over-expressing wild type RhoA or RhoA(S188A) alone or in combination with RhoGDI1 
(SFigure 6d). We therefore reasoned that over-expression of a RhoA mutant that does not 
interact with RhoGDI and incapable of sequestering it to reduce protein levels of 
endogenous RhoGTPases29 should also increase the duration of protrusions, and that over-
expression of RhoGDI should not correct the increased protrusion duration. Over-expression 
of RhoA(R68E), which is defective in binding RhoGDI 30, led to a dramatic increase in the 
amplitude and duration of protrusions. In sharp contrast to the phenotype caused by wild 
type RhoA or RhoA(S188A), over-expression of RhoGDI did not significantly alter the 
morphodynamics of protrusions caused by RhoA(R68E)(Fig.5; SFigure 7). Thus, the effect 
of RhoGDI on morphodynamics reported here depends on its ability to directly bind to 
RhoA.

Over-expression of RhoGDI reverses the effect of PKA inhibition on protrusion 
morphodynamics
PKA has many potential substrates that could be involved in the control of morphodynamics 
of protrusions. The foregoing experiments showed that PKA controls the timing of RhoA 
activity by phosphorylation of Ser188, and that this effect depends on the RhoGDI-RhoA 
interaction. To assess whether PKA modulation of RhoGDI-RhoA interaction is a master 
regulator of the duration and transverse propagation of protrusions we inhibited PKA with 
PKI and simultaneously over-expressed RhoGDI (SFigure 8). Over-expression of RhoGDI 
reversed the effect of PKA inhibition (Fig.6a; SFigure 8). Specifically, protrusion duration 
(Fig.6b,c) and their transverse propagation (Fig.6a) resembled control cells. Thus, PKA 
phosphorylation of RhoA and its resulting effects on RhoGDI-RhoA interaction control the 
cycling of functional RhoA activity, and thus protrusion-retraction cycles.
Adhesion-dependent activation of PKA during protrusions
As shown above, PKA shortens cell protrusions by increasing the affinity of RhoA for 
RhoGDI through RhoA phosphorylation. We next wished to ask whether protrusion might 
activate PKA, thereby initiating a self-inhibitory feedback mechanism. Disrupting actin 
filaments with latrunculin A or antibody blockade of integrins inhibits leading edge PKA 
activation6; however, integrin blockade also inhibited protrusion. To directly test the role of 
adhesion as a requirement for PKA activation, we examined zones in which adhesion was 
blocked yet passive protrusion was maintained. We produced micropatterned substrates 
comprised of alternating 16 µm wide fibronectin stripes and 16µm inert polylysine-
polyethylene glycol (PLL-PEG) stripes of (Fig.7a, left). Cells plated extended lamellipodia 
along the fibronectin stripes (Fig.7a middle; Movie 3) and tips of these lamellipodia had 
high level of PKA activity in the fibronectin-adherent regions (Fig.7a, right). The 
morphodynamic maps (Fig.7b) revealed cycles of similar duration in adherent and non-
adherent zones and those in the non-adherent zone were spatially connected to those in the 
adherent zone (black arrows, Fig.7b, top panel) suggesting that that edge movements in non-
adherent zones were passive extensions of those generated in adherent zones. In spite of 
ongoing protrusions, the cell edge in the non-adherent PLL-PEG coated strips was virtually 
devoid of PKA activity (Fig.7b, lower panel). Thus, the combination of protrusion and 
adhesion of the leading edge results in PKA activation, thereby explaining the occurrence of 
maximal PKA activity shortly after peak protrusion velocity (Fig.2f).
Discussion
Many motile cells pathfind by cycling between protrusion and retraction of the leading edge. 
We found that in PtK1 epithelial cells a single protrusion-retraction-protrusion cycle lasts 
∼80 s and spans a segment of the leading edge of about 5µm. To understand these highly 
localized morphodynamics, we examined the intersecting roles of PKA, RhoA and RhoGDI 
in the regulation of constitutively-migrating epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. Our 
experiments re-emphasize that transient and highly localized increases in RhoA activity are 
associated with protrusion28,31. Here, we report that the close association of RhoA activity 
with protrusion requires phosphorylation of RhoA(Ser 188) by PKA. This is evidenced by: 
First, inhibition of PKA decreased frequency and increased the duration of protrusions

formed at the leading edge. Second, PKA activity closely temporally correlated with both 
RhoA activity and edge advancement. Thirdly, correlation of protrusion and RhoA activity 
was altered in non-phosphorylatable RhoA(S188A). Phosphorylation of RhoA increases its 
affinity for RhoGDI18, leading to displacement of RhoA from the plasma membrane19,21 
and inhibition of effectors interactions. Over-expression of RhoGDI corrected the mistiming 
of RhoA(S188A) activation. Fourth, over-expression of RhoGDI corrected the effects of 
over expression of RhoA and RhoA(S188A) but not that of RhoA(R68E), a mutant which 
can not bind to RhoGDI30, on the timing of the protrusion-retraction cycle. Fifth, increased 
RhoGDI expression also overcame the effects of blocking PKA activity on protrusion 
morphodynamics. Together, these data show that the cycling of active RhoA at the plasma 
membrane controls the pace of the protrusion-retraction cycles. RhoA may control 
protrusion by promotion of actin nucleation through formins 32. Alternatively, collisions of 
transversely propagated protrusions lead to their termination and plays critical rode in 
determining their duration2. Therefore, by reducing the frequency of new protrusions, RhoA 
may prevent lateral inhibition, thereby resulting in protrusions of greater duration, amplitude 
and transverse propagation. In either case, here we, identify PKA activity, in particular its 
effect on RhoA- RhoGDI interaction by phosphorylating RhoA(Ser188), as a pacemaker of 
the protrusion-retraction cycle (Fig.7c).
PKA is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells6,7,17 and PKA inhibition reduces the 
number of protrusions formed at the leading edge6. In accord with those observations, we 
found that blocking PKA activity markedly widened the length-scale of protrusions while 
increasing their duration. This suggested that PKA activity limits a protrusion-promoting 
signal both in time and space. We propose that protrusion mechanically activates PKA via 
adhesion-mediated mechano-transduction, placing PKA in the core of a self-inhibiting 
feedback loop between RhoA and protrusion (Fig.7c). Mechanistically, this PKA activation 
may be induced by increasing tractional forces during protrusion events. In PtK1 cells 
traction force maxima lag behind the maximal protrusive velocity by ∼20 sec 3. In 
remarkable agreement with this timing, our data here show that the activation of PKA was 
also slightly delayed relative to the protrusion velocity. Thus, we find that the linked 
activities of integrins, PKA, and RhoA(Ser 188)-phosphorylation establishes a mechano-
responsive governor of the protrusion-retraction cycle.
Alternative mechanisms by which PKA could inhibit RhoA, include inhibition of Giα12,13 
signaling33 or inhibiting RhoGEF(s) function34,35. However, our data strongly favor direct 
phosphorylation on RhoA here. Specifically, mutating the PKA phosphorylation site in 
RhoA(S188A) leads to loss of positive correlation between protrusion and RhoA activity. 
RhoA phosphorylation could change its affinity for specific effectors36 or its lateral 
translocation into different membrane microdomains37 instead of affecting the interaction 
between RhoA and RhoGDI. However, these mechanisms would not readily explain the 
dramatic complementation by RhoGDI over-expression. Similarly, the finding that RhoGDI 
over-expression reversed all of the effects of PKA inhibition provides a compelling 
argument that the effects of PKA inhibition on morphodynamics is due to phosphorylation 
of RhoA and resulting increased affinity for RhoGDI. Therefore, direct phosphorylation by 
PKA controls RhoA activity cycles that regulate protrusion at the leading edge.

Previous studies suggested that that RhoGDI, along with GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) 
and GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), plays an active role in Rho GTPase turnover in 
cellular protrusions38. Our studies provide demonstrate that RhoA cycling regulated by PKA 
and RhoGDI is a part of protrusion-retraction pacemaker (Fig.7c). Therefore, the level of 
RhoGDI expression could set the gain function by which cell protrusive behavior responds 
to PKA activity as influenced, among other factors, by extracellular matrix composition6,39 
and substrate stiffness40. Hence, changes in RhoGDI expression might result in enhanced 
cellular migration on substrates characterized by otherwise suboptimal mechanical or 
chemical composition properties41, helping to explain the role RhoGDI plays in determining 
the invasive and metastatic properties of cancers42–44.

Micro-patterning of fibronectin on glass coverslips
Fibronectin was labeled with AnaTaq HiLyte Fluor 647 protein labeling kit (AnaSpec, 
Fremont, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. We fabricated polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) stamps with 16 µm stripes spaced 16µm apart 49 and used these stamps to print a 
micropatterned fluorescent fibronectin substrate as described 50. The nonprinted 16µm 
intervening stripes were back-filled with poly-L-lysine-polyethylene glycol (PLL-PEG), 
which renders them resistant to cell adhesion, by incubation of patterned coverslips for 30 
min in PBS pH 7.4 solution of 0.5mg/ml of PLL-PEG (mPEG1k-b-PLKC100, Alamanda 
Polymers, Hunsville, AL).

Image processing
Time lapse series were edited in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Figures were assembled in 
Photoshop CS2, Illustrator CS2 and InDesign CS2 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). 
For all other image processing we used home-written Matlab functions (MathWorks, Natick, 
MA).
FRET analysis
Processing of FRET data was done using automated custom-built Matlab software. Our 
program subtracts dark current from raw images followed by correction for light source 
intensity fluctuations, uneven illumination of the field, background autofluorescence, 
variations in concentration of biosensor within a cell51, and different rates of photobleaching 
for donor and acceptor fluorophores52.
Cell edge tracking
Cell edges were detected via an intensity-based segmentation of images with membrane-
bound fluorophor. The edge evolution in time was tracked computationally as described in2. 
Rates of protrusion and retraction (velocity maps) were calculated by finite differences of 
positions in consecutive frame triplets at T−1, T, and T+1 (SFigure 1).
Cross-Correlation analysis
Temporal cross-correlations between FRET signal and protrusion (edge velocity) windows 
at different lags were obtained in each sampling window (SFigure 1) by computing the 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The correlation for the entire leading edge of the cell was 
obtained by averaging the correlation coefficient over all sampling windows for each 
temporal lag. To investigate the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the cross-correlation between 
two activities, a common cross-correlation function was estimated by computing a 
smoothing spline for the ensemble of average cross-correlation data from different cells. The 
variance of the smoothing spline approximation and hence of the location of the maximum 
correlation was calculated by a non-parametric bootstrap method53. In this method the 
residuals of the approximated spline 2000 bootstrap samples were taken to reconstruct 2000 
cross-correlation samples. From this sample pool, local variation of the spline around mean, 
variation in maximum correlation coefficient, and variation in location of the maximum 
correlation (time lag) were inferred. The 95% confidence interval for the estimated common 
cross-correlation was obtained in each location as the interval containing 95% of the 
bootstrapped spline samples.
Temporal auto-correlation of protrusions/retractions was computed by cross-correlation of 
edge velocity with itself. To analyze the difference in the duration of protrusions/retractions 
we measured the peak width in the autocorrelation plot at an arbitrarily chosen correlation 
value of 0.2.
Protrusion and retraction length scale evaluation
Protrusions and retraction length scale is the distance along the edge of the cell over which 
protrusion and retraction events become statistically independent from each other. Edge

movements are defined as independent when the spatial auto-correlation level of leading 
edge movements falls below 50% of its maximum value. For each cell, the spatial auto-
correlation of edge movements where obtained by time-averaging the Pearson correlation 
coefficient at different spatial lags along the edge over the entire duration of the movie. A 
characteristic spatial auto-correlation of edge movements was calculated by fitting a 
smoothing spline to the ensemble of the auto-correlation data from different cells. The 
characteristic protrusion and retraction length scale was calculated from the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the characteristic spatial auto-correlation curve.
Statistical analysis
Averages and SEMs were calculated and are shown in the graphs. Respective n values are 
shown in the figure legends. The indicated P values were obtained with two-tailed Student’s 
t-tests.

Figure 1. PKA controls the characteristic time and magnitude of protrusive activity
a) PtK1 cell transfected with cDNA encoding membrane targeted GFP-CAAX was 
visualized by fluorescence microcopy and the localization of the GFP was used to define the 
cell edge; the multiple intracellular vesicular structures presumably contain newly-
synthesized GFP-CAAX en route to the plasma membrane. Cell transfected with mCherry-
PKI were identifie d by mCherry fluorescence. The red box indicates the region analyzed in 
the PKI-expressing cell in (b). Scale bar is 10 µm. b) Contours of the leading edges of two 
cells from series of images taken with 10 sec intervals over 50 min, with the color of the 
contour showing the time when the image was taken. c) Velocity maps of the protrusions 
along the cell leading edge, as evaluated from the evolution from the edge contours in (b). In 
the two upper panels, the abscissa indicates time, the ordinate indicates the position along 
the edge in terms of the segment number (left) and the absolute distance (right), and the 
color-coding of the diagram shows the local edge protrusion velocity ranging from −50 
(blue) to 50 (red) nm/sec. Oblique arrows (black and white) indicate transverse waves of 
protrusion propagating along the cell edge. The bottom panel is a plot of the edge velocity of 
the segments marked by the white dashed lines in the two upper panels. Similar maps were 
observed for mono and multi-nucleate PTK1 cells. d) Temporal auto-correlation of 
protrusion velocities. In control cell, protrusion and retraction events repeat every 130 sec 
(black arrow). Expression of PKI resulted in cycles of 820 sec (red arrow).

Figure 2. Temporal correlation of PKA activity with cell protrusion
a) Membrane-targeted FRET reporter of PKA activity was used to identify the cell edge 
(left) and to monitor PKA activity (right). Red box shows the region that was used for the 
analysis of PKA activity in protrusions. Scale bar is 10 µm. b) The cell edge was divided 
into segments of 2–3 µm long in accordance with the length scale of protrusion events (see 
text). Red and blue vectors correspond to protrusions and retractions, respectively. Cell edge 
displacements were calculated every 0.6 µm and averaged for each segment. For each 
segment, a series of consecutive 1µm deep sampling windows were defined with the first 
window adjacent to the edge. c) PKA activities (color and height) within 1 µm of the cell 
edge were measured as FRET ratios of pmAKAR3 (range = 1.8 (blue) to 2.8 (red)) at 10 sec 
intervals over a 720 sec interval for different segments. d) The leading edge position was 
assessed from cell images taken over 720 sec at 10 sec intervals and was used to calculate 
the protrusion or retraction velocity (color and height) as a function of time (abscissa) for 
each segment. Velocity values are color-coded from −50 nm/sec (blue) to 50 nm/sec (red). 
e) Spline fits representing average temporal autocorrelation of protrusions in a cell 
expressing the PKA FRET reporter and in control cells (n=7, 4 experiments). f) Spline fits 
representing temporal cross-correlation between the protrusion velocity and PKA activity at 
different distances from the cell edge (n=3, 3 experiments). Black crosses show the 95% 
confidence intervals for the location of cross-correlation peaks.

various enzymes: PKA (blue line, n=6, 4 experiments), RhoA (red line, n=5, 4 experiments), 
and RhoA(S188A) mutant (green line, n=4, 3 experiments). Black crosses show the 95% 
confidence intervals for the strongest correlations (positive or negative). Peak of PKA 
activity was 12 sec, [CI ±18] after maximal protrusion velocity, whereas peak of RhoA 
activity occurred 21.5 sec, [CI ±11] after maximal protrusion velocity. RhoA(S188A) 
activity had a negative correlation with protrusion velocity with a delay of 40 sec, [CI ±18].

morphodynamic protrusion map of the region in the white box in panel b color-coded from 
−50 nm/sec (blue) to 50 nm/sec (red). The white dashed lines outline the borders between 
adhesive (fibronectin) and non-adhesive (PLL-PEG) substrates. Protrusive domains 
indicated by arrows show the physical continuity of protrusions between the adherent and 
non-adherent zones. Bottom panel: a PKA activity map as FRET ratios of pmAKAR3 (range 
=3 (blue) to 5.5 (red)) within 1µm from the cell edge. PKA activity is absent in the non-
adherent zone. c) PKA, RhoA, and RhoGDI form a protrusion-retraction pacemaker. RhoA 
activity initiates protrusion of the adherent leading edge resulting in PKA activation. PKA 
phosphorylates RhoA at Ser188, leading to increased affinity for RhoGDI. RhoGDI binding 
both removes RhoA from the membrane and interferes with its coupling to effectors 
resulting in termination of protrusions, thereby completing a self-inhibiting negative 
feedback loop that acts as a pacemaker of the protrusion-retraction cycle. When PKA is 
inhibited or RhoA over-expression exceeds available RhoGDI, protrusion duration and 
amplitude are markedly increased. This much slower cycle suggests the existence of a 
second slower default pacemaker, such as the RhoA GTP-GDP cycle depicted in light gray.
