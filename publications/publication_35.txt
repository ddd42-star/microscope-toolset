Abstract
Transient versus sustained ERK MAP kinase (MAPK) activation
dynamics induce proliferation versus differentiation in response to
epidermal (EGF) or nerve (NGF) growth factors in PC-12 cells. Dura-
tion of ERK activation has therefore been proposed to specify cell
fate decisions. Using a biosensor to measure ERK activation dynam-
ics in single living cells reveals that sustained EGF/NGF application
leads to a heterogeneous mix of transient and sustained ERK acti-
vation dynamics in distinct cells of the population, different than
the population average. EGF biases toward transient, while NGF
biases toward sustained ERK activation responses. In contrast,
pulsed growth factor application can repeatedly and homoge-
neously trigger ERK activity transients across the cell population.
These datasets enable mathematical modeling to reveal salient
features inherent to the MAPK network. Ultimately, this predicts
pulsed growth factor stimulation regimes that can bypass the typi-
cal feedback activation to rewire the system toward cell differenti-
ation irrespective of growth factor identity.

Introduction
Complex signaling networks allow cells to translate external stimuli
into specific cell fates. In many cases, signaling dynamics rather
than steady states control these fate decisions (Levineet al, 2013;
Purvis & Lahav, 2013). Furthermore, signaling states of individual
cells differ even across an isogenic population (Cohen-Saidonet al,
2009; Snijder & Pelkmans, 2011; Chenet al, 2012), due to broad
distributions of protein abundances, as well as intrinsic noise
present within all biochemical networks (Snijder & Pelkmans,
2011). Measuring single-cell signaling dynamics is therefore a key to
understand how cellular responses correlate with fate decisions.
The extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) regulates cellular fates
such as proliferation and differentiation. It functions within a mito-
gen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling network in which
growth factor (GF) receptors activate a Ras GTPase, subsequently
triggering a MAPK cascade leading to ERK activation (Avraham &
Yarden, 2011). Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells have been
used as a model system to study MAPK-dependent fate decisions
(Marshall, 1995). Stimulation with EGF or NGF leads to transient or
sustained ERK activation dynamics, respectively, triggering prolifera-
tion or differentiation (Marshall, 1995; Avraham & Yarden, 2011).
These different ERK activation dynamics involve activation of dif-
ferent Ras isoforms (Sasagawaet al, 2005), as well as GF-dependent
control of the MAPK network topology (Santoset al, 2007), with
negative or positive feedbacks producing adaptive or bistable outputs
(Xiong & Ferrell, 2003; Santoset al, 2007; Avraham & Yarden, 2011).
Downstream, molecular interpretation of signal duration involves
stabilization of ERK-induced immediate early gene (IEG) products by
sustained ERK activity, ultimately instructing the differentiation fate
(Murphyet al, 2002; Nakakukiet al, 2010). Single-cell analysis has,
however, revealed that NGF does not lead to homogeneous PC-12 cell
differentiation. Rather, a heterogeneous mix of differentiating and
proliferating cells is observed, with the respective cell fate choices
depending on a complex ERK and AKT signaling code (Chenet al,
2012). Here, we study ERK activation dynamics in GF-stimulated
single PC-12 cells. We find that sustained GF stimulation induces
heterogeneous cell responses different than the population average,
with both GFs being able to produce transient and sustained ERK acti-
vation responses. We dynamically probe the ERK signaling flux
through application of GF pulses, which homogenizes ERK activation

responses throughout the cell population. This provides novel insight
to understand the MAPK network structure and ultimately provides a
rationale to rewire cell fate decisions independently of GF identity.
Results
Sustained GF stimulation induces heterogeneous ERK
activation dynamics
To study ERK activation dynamics in single PC-12 cells, we produced
a stable cell line that expresses EKAR2G, a fluorescence resonance
energy transfer-based biosensor for endogenous ERK activity (Fig 1A)
(Harveyet al, 2008; Fritz et al, 2013). This biosensor specifically
reports on ERK, but not on p38 mitogen-activated, neither on c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (Harveyet al, 2008). By virtue of a nuclear export
sequence, EKAR2G localizes to, and specifically measures ERK activ-
ity in the cytosol (Fig 1B). Although this does not seem to be true for
all cell types (Ahmedet al, 2014), we assumed that cytosolic and
nuclear pools of ERK activity are in equilibrium, since, at least for
EGF-stimulated PC-12 cells, there is no apparent time lag between
nuclear and cytosolic ERK activation dynamics (Herbstet al,2 0 1 1 ) .
Biosensor expression levels were homogeneous and displayed only
small standard deviation with respect to the population median
(Appendix Fig S1A). To match the temporal resolution enabled by
our biosensor, we used a flow-based, computer-programmable
microfluidic device to deliver GFs with precise kinetics (Fig 1C). We
observed that flow induced transient ERK activation (Appendix Fig
S1B and C). This most likely results from flow-induced mechanical
stress, and/or exposure to low amount of serum required for cell
survival in the live cell imaging experiments. Subsequent experi-
ments were then performed after the flow effect has subsided, leading
to a flat baseline (Appendix Fig S1D).
Throughout this study, we used high-dosage, 25 ng/ml EGF and
50 ng/ml NGF (representing equivalent GF molarities (Santoset al,
2007)), and low-dosage, 1 ng/ml EGF and 2 ng/ml NGF concentra-
tions. As previously described (Santoset al, 2007), Western blot
analysis showed that high-dosage EGF triggered a single ERK activa-
tion peak that almost nearly returned to baseline after 10–15 min
(Fig 1D). In contrast, high-dosage NGF evoked one ERK activation
peak followed by sustained, but reduced with respect to the peak,
ERK activity. Similar ERK activation dynamics profiles were
observed in population-averaged EKAR2G measurements (Fig 1E).
At the single-cell level, however, a mix of transient, oscillatory, and
sustained ERK activity trajectories were observed (Fig 1F–H, Video
EV1), showing that EGF- and NGF-induced ERK activation kinetics
are the result of heterogeneous cell responses distinct from the popu-
lation average. This signaling heterogeneity was not a consequence
of the small but existing heterogeneity in EKAR2G expression levels.
Specifically, we have not observed any correlation between bio-
sensor expression levels and NGF-triggered ERK activity at 400 after
stimulation, a time point and experimental condition at which highly
heterogeneous ERK activity is observed in the cell population
(Appendix Fig S1E). Furthermore, immunostaining experiments con-
firmed this heterogeneity— after the 1st activation peak, the phospho-
ERK signal displayed a higher average and amplitude spread for NGF
in comparison with EGF (Fig EV1A–C). Comparison of population-
averaged ERK activity measurements using Western blot (Fig 1D), or
immunofluorescence (Fig EV1B), versus EKAR2G (Fig 1E), revealed
somewhat slower desensitization kinetics of the 1st ERK activity peak
for the latter. Immunofluorescence analysis of native versus
EKAR2G-expressing PC-12 cells revealed a slight lag of 1st peak
phosphoERK desensitization kinetics in the latter cells (Fig EV1D),
without however affecting the amplitudes of EGF versus NGF phos-
phoERK signals after the first peak. This indicates that biosensor
expression affects the MAPK signaling network to some extent.
Biosensor FRET ratio measurements do not necessarily scale linearly
with the signaling events they report on, and it has previously
proven valuable to explicitly model this (Birtwistleet al, 2011; Fujita
et al, 2014). However, given the strong similarity between the
Western blot, immunofluorescence, and EKAR2G datasets, we
assumed that FRET ratio measurements could be used directly as a
proxy for ERK activity. These results indicate that, while EKAR2G
expression has a slight impact on a specific phase of ERK activation
dynamics, it remains a faithful indicator of ERK signaling.
To quantify cell heterogeneity, we pooled all high- and low-dosage,
EGF- and NGF-triggered ERK activation trajectories described above
(Fig 1E–H), and used k-means clustering to extract 5 representative
temporal activation patterns (Fig 2A). We then determined their inci-
dence in response to the different GF dosages (Fig 2B and C) and
found that EGF favored adaptive responses, while NGF led to a larger
number of sustained ERK activity trajectories. We also observed ultra-
sensitive and switch-like ERK responses for increasing dosages of EGF
and NGF. The 1st peak amplitudes saturated and remained unchanged
above threshold concentrations of 1 ng/ml EGF and 2 ng/ml NGF
(Fig EV2A and B). At lower concentrations, lower and more heteroge-
neous 1st ERK activity peak amplitudes were observed. A striking
observation was that the different representative ERK activity trajecto-
ries displayed distinct 1st ERK activity peak amplitudes that correlated
with the ability to produce a transient or a sustained response— cells
with low or high 1st peak amplitude, respectively, produced transient
or sustained responses (Fig 2A–D). For additional quantification of
this phenomenon, we correlated 1st peak amplitude with long-term,
400 , ERK activity (indicating transient or sustained ERK activity).
Robust correlation was observed for high and low NGF dosages,
suggesting that high 1st ERK peak amplitude leads to sustained
responses (Appendix Fig S2). Non-significant correlations were
observed for high and low EGF dosages. Another interesting observa-
tion was that a low EGF dosage significantly shifted the distribution of
ERK activity trajectories toward more sustained profiles when
compared to the high EGF dosage (Fig 2A–C). Importantly, such
subtle shifts in the distribution of ERK activity profiles are not appar-
ent when a population average is computed (Fig 1G), illustrating the
value of our clustering approach to analyze our single-cell trajectories
datasets. Together, these results show that GF stimulation produces
heterogeneous ERK activity responses, with both GFs being able to
induce transient and sustained responses in different cells of the
population. This most likely results from different strengths of EGF-
triggered negative and NGF-triggered positive feedbacks within dif-
ferent cells. In the case of NGF, the presence or absence of sustained
ERK activation responses might depend on the strength of the positive
feedback (Ferrell & Machleder, 1998), which is consistent with the
finding that the amplitude of the 1st peak correlates with the establish-
ment of a sustained response. Sustained responses might, however,
also result from lack of adaptation through negative feedback and
continuous signaling input due to constant GF exposure.

Pulsed GF stimulation reveals novel features of the
MAPK network
Because continuous signaling input does not effectively probe
the MAPK network to produce adaptive or bistable responses
(Kholodenko et al, 2010; Avraham & Yarden, 2011), we applied
single GF pulses using our microfluidic device. A high-dosage,
30 and 100 EGF, or 30 NGF pulse elicited a robust peak of ERK
activity that immediately adapted (Fig 3A and B, and Video EV2).
In contrast, a 100 NGF pulse induced sustained ERK activity within

a cell subpopulation, potentially indicating bistability (Xiong &
Ferrell, 2003), while the remaining cells exhibited transient
responses (Fig 3B). As for sustained NGF stimulation, cell trajec-
tory clustering again indicated a correlation between first peak
amplitude, and the ability to produce a sustained response
(Appendix Fig S3). Low-dosage, 30 and 100 , EGF and NGF single
pulses all led to adaptive responses (Fig 3C and D). All GF pulses,
as well as sustained GF stimulation, evoked a robust 1st ERK
activity peak, with similar amplitude distributions across the
different dosages, indicating switch-like responses (Fig 3E and F).
In marked contrast with sustained GF stimulation, population-
homogeneous, rapid desensitization kinetics were observed for
pulsed GF stimulation, except for cells and conditions in which
bistable behavior was triggered by NGF (Fig 3E and G). These
results show that EGF only induces adaptive, while NGF can
produce both adaptive and bistable outputs depending on input
strength/duration.
To explore the timescale at which adaptation occurs, we retrig-
gered ERK activity by a delayed, 2nd 30 EGF or NGF pulse, which
only can induce adaptive ERK activity transients. Retriggering
after a 30 delay, when ERK activity still peaked, did not affect
ERK activation kinetics (Fig 4A). Retriggering after a 10 0 delay,
when ERK activity already displayed significant desensitization,
led to a 2 nd ERK activity peak of lower amplitude (Fig 4B).
Retriggering after a 20 0 delay, when adaptation had occurred,
enabled a 2nd activity peak of similar amplitude as the 1st one
(Fig 4C). For both EGF and NGF, the MAPK network structure
therefore makes ERK refractory to re-activation until adaptation
has occurred.
In addition to the feedback loops to upstream components that
operate on timescales of minutes, ERK also induces expression of
dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) which negatively regulate
ERK on a timescale of hours (Pattersonet al, 2009). Consistently,
evaluation of ERK activity trajectories for 5 h after sustained GF
stimulation displayed a global long-term trend to ERK adaptation
for both EGF and NGF at high and low dosages (Appendix Fig S4).
The heterogeneity inherent to these ERK responses makes it diffi-
cult to discern any patterns of regulation operating at the hour
timescale. We therefore reasoned that repeatable GF pulses could
trigger multiple ERK activity transients homogeneously across the
cell population, as the refractory periods effectively reduced noise.
Such a pulsing input might therefore provide a robust readout for
long-term, hour-scale feedback loops. We therefore evaluated 30
GF multi-pulse regimes with varying pause duration and GF

dosages (Fig 4D–G, single-cell trajectories shown in Appendix Fig
S5 and Video EV3). A high-dosage EGF, 30 GF/30 pause multi-pulse
regime led to a robust single ERK activation peak that rapidly
subsided, while the identical NGF pulse regime exhibited dimin-
ished ERK desensitization (Fig 4D). The 30 /100 and 30 /200 regimes
triggered well-resolved ERK activity transients whose amplitude
diminished over time, to a higher extent for EGF than for NGF
(Fig 4E and F, and Video EV4). Lower desensitization appeared for
the low versus the high EGF dosages, while this difference was
much smaller for high and low NGF dosages (Fig 3D–F). The 30 /
600 regimes did not lead to pronounced long-term ERK activity
desensitization (Fig 3G). Figure 3H quantifies the hour-scale decay
of ERK activity maxima. These results clearly identify distinct
hour-scale negative feedbacks that depend on GF concentration
and identity and that are not distinguishable using sustained GF
stimulation.
Modeling MAPK network structure
Dynamic responses of the MAPK signaling to sustained GF stimula-
tions have been extensively modeled in the literature (Kholodenko,
2000, 2006; Santoset al, 2007; von Kriegsheim et al, 2009;
Kholodenko et al, 2010; Nakakukiet al, 2010). Our dynamic prob-
ing of ERK signaling using GF pulses in single living cells provides
for a unique opportunity to calibrate the models to a much higher
detail and study the dynamics at temporal scales inaccessible
through standard population-averaged measurements. This allowed
us to refine established models by incorporating novel feedback and
crosstalk structures that are required to explain the salient features
identified in our experiments (Fig 5A). Our core model consists of
the classic Raf/MEK/ERK cascade with a short-term (on the time-
scale of minutes) negative feedback from ERK to Raf that acts for
both EGF and NGF stimulations, and a short-term positive feedback

from ERK to Raf only during NGF stimulation (Santoset al, 2007).
An additional negative feedback via the expression of DUSPs that
inactivate ERK through dephosphorylation operates on the timescale
of hours (Nakakukiet al, 2010; Feyet al, 2012) (Fig 5A).
Two extensions of the core model are critical for explaining the
salient features revealed by our pulsing experiments. First, in the
30 /30 ,3 0 /100 , and 30 /200 multi-pulse EGF regimes, we observed that
the high- and low-dosage EGF responses diverge for the later time
points even though the 1st ERK activity peak amplitudes are identi-
cal (e.g., the 1st 200 ) (Fig 4D–G). It is well established that ERK
desensitization in response to EGF is caused by the activation of
negative feedback loops (Santoset al, 2007; Fritsche-Guentheret al,
2011; Fey et al, 2012). However, the fact that the 1st ERK activity
peaks are identical in response to the different EGF dosages implies
that negative feedback alone cannot account for the observed long-
term differences— a pure feedback mechanism exclusively depend-
ing on ERK would be activated to the same amount. Thus, we
explicitly introduced an additional feed-forward component, NFB,
whose activation depends on both active ERK and receptor activity
(Fig 5A). Second, we observed that a high-dosage 100 NGF pulse
elicited sustained ERK activity in a cell subpopulation, suggesting
the presence of bistability (Fig 3B, Appendix Fig S3). In contrast,
high- and low-dosage 30 NGF and low-dosage 100 NGF single pulses
only elicited transient, adaptive ERK activity profiles throughout the
cell population (Fig 3A–D). Considering that all pulsed NGF stimulation
conditions led to an identical 1st ERK activity peak implies the
existence of (i) a slight delay in the activation of the NGF-evoked
positive feedback and (ii) an additional regulation of the ERK-Raf

positive feedback strength, which would explain the induction of
adaptive or sustained ERK activation. In the model, we accounted
for the delay by including a positive feedback component, PFB, with
kinetics on the observed timescales, and made the activation of this
component dependent on receptor activity (Fig 5A). Note that the
slight delay is caused implicitly by the activation of this feedback
component, which takes time, not by introducing an explicit delay
equation. A detailed account of all reactions and equations of the
model is provided in Appendix Table S1.
Benchmarking model simulations against experimental data
To validate our model, we benchmarked simulated GF-evoked ERK
activity outputs against experimental data. Using a purely determinis-
tic approach with a fixed parameter set, our model captured the
average behavior of the measured ERK activity trajectories in
response to both sustained and 30 pulse EGF and NGF stimulation
(Fig 5B). However, the simulations fitted the experimental
population average much better in case of a 30 pulse than sustained
GF stimulation. The reason being that sustained stimulation induces
highly heterogeneous cell responses that deterministic modeling
cannot account for. In contrast, cell responses due to a 30 GF pulse
are more homogeneous and hence better represented by the
population average.
To take into account cell heterogeneity, we performed semi-
deterministic modeling that was based on the same deterministic
equations, but with individual cells simulated with total protein
concentrations of signaling components randomly chosen from a
log-normal distribution that corresponds to the distribution of
protein abundances across the cell population (Fig 5C and D).
Specifically, we sought to explain the emergence of sustained ERK
activation in response to a 100 high-dosage NGF pulse in a cell
subpopulation, versus the population-homogeneous, transient
responses observed in all other EGF/NGF pulsed stimulation condi-
tions (Fig 3A–D). Simulating the ensemble model mimicked the
experimental data in all the single EGF and NGF pulse conditions
tested (Fig 5E and F). In the case of the 100 NGF pulse, k-means
clustering of simulated ERK activity trajectories indicated a correla-
tion between initial ERK peak activity amplitude, and sustained
ERK activity response (Appendix Fig S6), which recapitulated our
experimental data (Appendix Fig S3). In contrast, low initial ERK
peak activity amplitude led to adaptation. This suggests that dif-
ferences in signaling component expression levels across the popu-
lation might induce some cells to display high initial ERK peak
activity leading to sufficiently strong positive feedback to induce
bistable ERK activation (Ferrell & Machleder, 1998; Santoset al,
2007). However, the inability of the system to sustain bistability
over time can be explained by the slow-acting, DUSP-catalyzed ERK
dephosphorylation. Removing ERK-induced DUSP expression from
the model enabled robust bistable ERK activation. Together, these
results show that, depending on the heterogeneity in abundance of
signaling component in different cells of the population, the
network is capable of inducing adaptive and sustained ERK activity
outputs in response to a transient NGF stimulus. We also modeled
sustained GF stimulation using semi-deterministic modeling and
found that our model captured several aspects of our experimental
datasets (Fig 5E and F). The model captured the emergence of more
sustained ERK activity trajectories in cells stimulated with low
versus high EGF concentrations, which arises through modulation
of negative feedback through receptor activity (compare distribu-
tions of simulated ERK activity trajectories in Fig 5E with experi-
mental ones in Fig 2B). These results again show that heterogeneity
in abundance of signaling components leads to emergence of
distinct cell behaviors in the population.
To confirm that our proposed model structure did not contain
unnecessary regulatory elements, we benchmarked simulations
from alternative model structures against experimental data. A
model in which the feed-forward crosstalk was removed could not
explain the differences between the low and high NGF dosage, 100
pulse stimulations (Fig EV3A and B). A model in which the delay
introduced by the negative feedback component and the feed-
forward crosstalk have been removed by making the Raf activation
directly dependent on active ERK could not explain the differences
between the 30 and 100 pulse stimulations (Fig EV3C and D).
We then used deterministic modeling to benchmark our model
against the GF multi-pulse experimental datasets, in which homoge-
neous cell responses are faithfully reflected by the population
average. Consistently, the deterministic model calibrated to popula-
tion-averaged time courses replicated the multi-pulse experiments
(Fig 6A). This captured the different hour-scale ERK activity ampli-
tude decays observed experimentally in response to different GFs
and dosages (Fig 4D–G), which can be explained by ERK-induced
expression of DUSP phosphatases, producing a slow-acting negative
feedback dephosphorylating ERK. To further test the relevance of
the DUSP module, we removed it from the network and observed a
loss of long-term adaptive behavior (Fig EV4A and B). The observa-
tion that 30 /30 ,3 0 /100 , and 30 /200 EGF multi-pulse regimes caused
the stronger decay of the ERK activity amplitudes at high versus low
EGF dosages arises from the regulation of the negative feedback
strength by the receptor activity. Consistently, a model in which this
interaction is removed failed to explain the decrease of ERK activity
peak amplitude observed in response to high versus low EGF dosage

(Fig EV4C and D). In particular, the loss of explanatory power in
this model could not be recovered by changing the values of the
negative feedback parameter.
We also explored the potential involvement of EGF receptor
internalization and degradation (Avraham & Yarden, 2011), to
test whether this process could be involved in the long-term
desensitization observed in high versus low EGF dosages in
multi-pulse experiments. We therefore removed the receptor cross-
talk to the negative feedback and replaced it by explicitly modeling
receptor degradation and internalization using a range of degrada-
tion parameter rates (Fig EV5). We found that blocking internal-
ization or changing internalization/degradation rates affected ERK
activation dynamics in multi-pulse experiments, but in an EGF
dosage-independent fashion. Thus, EGF receptor internalization/
degradation cannot account for the ERK activity responses we
observe experimentally.
Finally, because a receptor activity-dependent, feed-forward
component that modulates the strength of the positive feedback
(Fig 5A) was important to explain both the heterogeneous, adaptive,
or bistable ERK activation responses in response to single NGF
pulses (Fig 5C–F), as well as the NGF multi-pulse datasets (Fig 6A),
we analyzed it more in detail. More specifically, we explored dif-
ferent modalities, linear dependency versus hill-shaped kinetics,
for modeling the strength of this feed-forward component
(Appendix Note 1). We observed that these different modeling
modalities did not affect the output of model-simulated ERK activity
trajectories in response to both single 30 and 100 single high- and
low-dosage NGF pulses, as well as our multi-pulse datasets
(Appendix Fig S7). Together, our combined experimental/modeling
approach strongly supports the proposed structure of our model.
Rewiring cell fate using pulsed GF stimulation
The integrated ERK activity over time, ERKINT, has been correlated
with cell fate determination in different cell systems (Murphyet al,
2002; Santos et al, 2007; Albecket al, 2013; Aokiet al, 2013). We
reasoned that synthetic GF multi-pulse regimes might precisely
manipulate duration of ERK signaling, and ultimately the differentia-
tion fate. Using our model, we predicted temporal GF pulse/pause
regimes that optimize ERKINT levels (Fig 6B), and found that distinct
GF pulse regimes lead to different ERKINT levels. Long-term EKAR2G
imaging induced phototoxicity that hampered differentiation,
precluding direct ERKINT/differentiation correlation at a single-cell
level. We therefore subjected cells to different pulse regimes for
13 h followed by additional 24 h in GF-free medium, and quantified
steady-state neurite outgrowth as a measure of differentiation
(Fig 7A and B) using an automated neurite/soma segmentation
algorithm (Appendix Fig S8A). Statistical analysis of this dataset is
also shown (Appendix Fig S8B). As expected, sustained EGF and
NGF stimulation, respectively, led to undifferentiated and differenti-
ated states. 30 /30 ,3 0 /100 ,3 0 /200 high NGF dosage multi-pulse regimes
led to a statistically significant increase in differentiation compared
to sustained NGF stimulation, while the 30 /600 regime did not lead
to differentiation at all. While not as robust as NGF in terms of
neurite length (and thus differentiation ratio), we found that 30 /100
and 30 /200 , but not 30 /30 nor 30 /600 , high and low EGF dosage
multi-pulse regimes induced a potent differentiated state. However,
neither sustained application of low NGF nor a 30 /100 low NGF
multi-pulse regime led to robust differentiation, despite the fact that
these stimulation protocols lead to similar ERKINT levels than with
high NGF dosage. This suggests that high NGF dosage is required to
trigger additional signaling pathways that are important for neuronal
differentiation and/or survival. Our experiments show that, except
for low NGF concentrations, model-predicted ERKINT optimization
using synthetic EGF or NGF multi-pulse regimes with specific
frequencies lead to robust differentiation. In the case of EGF, such
frequency-modulated synthetic multi-pulse regimes therefore
convert a proliferation into a differentiation signal, and allow for
control of cell fate independently of GF identity. Maintenance of
sustained ERK activity through synthetic multi-pulse regimes
most likely enables for IEG product stabilization through their phos-
phorylation that can then instruct the differentiation fate (Murphy
et al, 2002; Nakakuki et al, 2010). The loss of any differentiation
in response to stimulation with 600 -spaced adaptive ERK activity
transients can be explained by the very short-lived nature of IEG
mRNAs and proteins (Murphyet al, 2002; Avraham & Yarden,
2011).

heterogeneous when single cells within a population are
analyzed. Our single-cell measurement approach therefore clearly
enhances previous models based on cell population averages
(Marshall, 1995; Santoset al, 2007; von Kriegsheim et al, 2009;
Shin et al, 2009; Nakakuki et al, 2010). Important problems
encountered with sustained growth factor application are that
heterogeneous ERK activity dynamics responses preclude the use
of deterministic modeling, and do not allow us to properly evalu-
ate MAPK network properties such as adaptation and bistability.
Dynamically probing the MAPK signaling flux by applying pulsed
growth factor inputs solves both issues. This allowed us to
uncover novel features of the MAPK network topology that
consists of different feedback and feed-forward loops acting at
different timescales.
Our study clearly indicates the existence of feed-forward
networks by which receptor activity regulates the strength of the
positive and negative feedback loops to fine-tune ERK activity. This
is consistent with a recent report in which EGF-triggered ERK
dynamics regulating cell cycle entry required receptor-dependent
signaling events in addition to the feedback loops operating within
the core Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade (Spartaet al, 2015). The most
likely candidate feed-forward mechanisms that impinges on the
positive feedback loop from ERK to Raf involves protein kinase C
(Santoset al, 2007) and PLCc (von Kriegsheimet al, 2009). For the
negative feedback loop, candidates include the phosphorylation
of Raf at inhibitory sites and the action of as of yet unidentified
kinases (reviewed in (Matallanaset al, 2011)), or the AKT-mediated
disruption of the PEA-15–ERK complex, which is part of the NGF

differentiation program (von Kriegsheim et al, 2009). Concerning
the latter, release from the PEA-15 complex would relieve competi-
tive inhibition and allow ERK to phosphorylate several upstream
negative feedback sites. Furthermore, recent proteomic analysis of
the dynamic, EGF-triggered, interactome of the adaptor Shc1 (Zheng
et al, 2013) has identified a temporally regulated AKT feedback
phosphorylation of Shc that recruits the tyrosine phosphatase
Ptpn12, ultimately leading to EGF receptor dephosphorylation, Grb2
dissociation, and signal termination. All these possibilities provide
attractive means to translate strength of receptor activity into modu-
lation of negative and positive feedback, and will have to be system-
atically studied in the future.
One important insight enabled by our study is that EGF solely
leads to adaptive ERK activation (in the absence of continuous
signaling input), while NGF can generate both adaptive and bistable
outputs depending on growth factor input strength/duration and on
population signaling heterogeneity. The latter feature possibly arises
from stochastic expression levels of signaling components as shown
by our modeling studies. As previously proposed (Chenet al, 2012),
this might enable the MAPK network to maintain a homeostatic
balance of cell fates in response to NGF, preventing excessive prolif-
eration or differentiation, which would be detrimental to multicellu-
lar organisms.
We also find that re-triggering the MAPK network multiple times,
while maintaining it in an adaptive regime, homogenizes the signal-
ing state across the cell population. This proved essential to uncover
feedback signaling mechanisms that occur on hourly timescales that
are difficult to discern in heterogeneous cell responses in response
to sustained growth factor stimulation. Based on our enhanced
model of the MAPK signaling network, optimization of integrated
ERK activity by delivery of GF pulse regimes at specific frequencies
can then be used to efficiently rewire cell fate decisions indepen-
dently of GF identity, in the absence of any drugs or gene perturba-
tions. Thus, stimulation with EGF pulses delivered at the required
frequency to optimize integrated ERK activity leads to differentiation
rather than proliferation. This might have a number of biotechno-
logical applications. However, we also found that in some instances,
GF pulsing schemes that lead to identical integrated ERK activity do
not necessarily lead to the same level of differentiation (Fig 7, high
versus low NGF dosages). Not surprisingly, this suggests that
depending on the GF, additional signaling networks than ERK are
important for cell fate decisions.
We foresee that our pulsed growth factor stimulation strategy,
which allows us to bypass cellular heterogeneity, probe for specific
network properties, and identify feedback loops that operate at dif-
ferent timescales, will be a powerful tool to identify the precise
molecular circuitry in the MAPK network, when combined with
perturbation approaches.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines
PC-12 (American tissue culture collection) and its Neuroscreen-1
subclone (a kind gift from Tobias Meyer) cells were cultured in
DMEM (Sigma, Germany) supplemented with 10% horse serum,
5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
tested for mycoplasma contamination using polymerase chain
reaction-based kits. Cells were cultured on 50 lg/ml collagen
solution from bovine skin (Sigma, Germany). For that purpose,
tissue culture dishes (BD falcon, USA) were collagen-coated at room
temperature for 30 min before cell seeding. At 70% confluence, cells
were gently detached using a Cell scraper and passaged. Due to their
decreased propensity to aggregate, Neuroscreen-1 cells were used in
experiments in which cell fate was analyzed. This greatly facilitated
neurite outgrowth analysis.
For stable cell line generation, we produced lentiviral particles
expressing the ERK activity biosensor EKAR2G1 (Fritzet al, 2013).
Briefly, HEK293 FT cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with lentivi-
ral and packaging constructs. Supernatant was then collected and
concentrated using a Lenti-X Concentrator Kit (Clontech). PC-12
cells were infected and selected with 0.5lg/ml puromycin until a
stable cell population appeared. Cells were subsequently cultured in
the presence of 0.5lg/ml puromycin, which was removed before
imaging experiments. PC-12/EKAR2G cells were used for imaging
ERK activation dynamics.
Construction and handling of microfluidic devices
We used a modified version of a previously described microfluidic
circuit to apply chemokine gradient to cells (Leeet al, 2012). Slight
modifications of the construction of the microfluidic circuit allowed
us to deliver GF pulses. The microfluidic silicon master was repli-
cated from a silicon wafer with SU-8 microstructures. The silicon
master mold was composed of two 40-lm- and 100-lm-thick layers
of photoresist. First, the plasma-treated silicon wafer was spin-
coated with SU-8 100 (Microchem, USA) negative thick photoresist
until a height of 40lm was achieved. After baking at 65°C for 50
and 95°C for 200 , the wafer was exposed to 405-nm ultraviolet light
(Shinu MST, Korea) with a 250-mJ dose and masked by the negative
film mask (Han&All Tech, Korea). After this 1st round of exposure,
the wafer was baked again at 65°C for 10 and 95°C for 100 . SU-8
developer (Microchem, USA) was then used to remove the unex-
posed part of the photoresist. For deposition of the 2nd photoresist
layer, the film mask for the second master was correctly positioned
using the alignment pattern on the first layer of the wafer. The
photoresist for the second layer was then spin-coated until a 100-lm
thickness was achieved. The wafer was baked at 65°C for 100 and
95°C for 300 and exposed to 500 mJ of 405-nm UV light. After a final
baking step at 65°C for 10 and 95°C for 100 , the wafer was dipped
into the developer, and baked to evaporate the residual solvents on
the top.
Poly-dimethylsilosane (PDMS) was used to replicate the master.
The precursor (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was mixed at a 10:1 ratio
and degassed in a vacuum chamber for 5 min. About 7 g precursor
was then poured on the top of the master, and solidified at 80°Ci na
dry oven for 300 . The plastic reservoir from a 8-well strip (Evergreen
sci, USA) was then glued on top of the microfluidic device using
precursor. These reservoirs contain the medium and growth factors
and allow us to connect the microfluidic device to the ONIX pres-
sure pump (Millipore). An additional layer of 30 g of precursor was
added to seal the plastic reservoir. As shown in Fig 1C, the PDMS
replica was cut and punched. Plasma treatment was used to bond
the PDMS replica to the coverslip (Tasumi, Japan) to allow
proper sealing that resists the high-pressure applied during the

experiments. To enhance the bonding strength, the device was
heated for 5 min in a 80°C dry oven. After bonding, the device was
immediately filled with PBS.
The microfluidic devices were coated using 50lg/ml of collagen
overnight at 4°C. Before cell seeding, devices were rinsed with PBS.
PC12/EKAR2G or NS-1 cell suspensions were prepared at a concen-
tration of 2× 106 cells/ml. 50 ll of this cell suspension was added
in the outlet and aspirated with a pipette from the cell reservoir inlet
port (Fig 1C). After a 300 incubation, residual cells in the outlet were
removed by aspiration and the medium was replaced. Prior experi-
ments, the cells were starved in DMEM containing 1,000 mg/ml
glucose, 1% horse serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. Note that
the flow is constant throughout the live cell experiments. This
implies that after shear stress adaptation, GF-induced signaling
responses can be reliably measured. Furthermore, there is a limit to
the minimal GF pulse time that can be applied. Pulses that stably
last less than 60 s require an amount of flow that will lead to cell
detachment.
Live cell imaging
All FRET ratio-imaging experiments were performed on an epifluo-
rescence Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with
a Plan Apo air 20× (NA 0.75) objective controlled by Metamorph
software (Molecular Devices). Laser-based autofocus was used
throughout the experiments. Image acquisition was performed with
a Hamamatsu Orca R2 camera at a 16-bit depth. Donor, FRET, and
red channel images (to visualize an Alexa546-dextran that indi-
cates GF exposure) were acquired sequentially using filter wheels.
The following excitation, dichroic mirrors, and emission filters
(Chroma) were used: donor channel: 430/24×, Q465LP, 480/40 m;
FRET channel: 430/24×, Q465LP, 535/30 m; and mCherry channel:
ET572/35, 89006bs, 632/60 m (for dextran imaging). Standard
exposition settings were used throughout the experiments. 440-nm
(donor and FRET channel excitation) and 565-nm (red dextran)
LED lamps were used as light sources (Lumencor Spectra X light
engine), with 1.1% (440 nm) and 1.5% (565 nm) of lamp power.
Acquisition times were 300 ms for donor channel and 300 ms for
FRET at binning 2× 2. Cells were imaged in DMEM with
1,000 mg/ml glucose, 1% horse serum, and penicillin/strepto-
mycin, at 37°C. The microfluidic device was mounted on the
microscope stage and was connected by the tubing to the ONIX
pump.

FRET ratio images produced with the EKAR2G biosensor were
analyzed using a combination of ImageJ and Metamorph. Donor
and FRET images were background-subtracted image by image. The
FRET was divided by the donor channel, and multiplied by 1,000 to
produce a 16-bit ratio image using the imageJ “calculator plus”
plugin. The stacked ratio images were then transferred to Meta-
morph. Each cell was then segmented based on time averaged stack
that provides a “footprint mask” for cellular movement of each cell,
and stacks for each individual cells were created. Cell aggregates
were manually segmented and discarded. The average ratio of each
cell through time was measured using ImageJ, and saved in text
files. Since every experiment involved a 2-h initial period to stabilize
cells to shear stress, we set the average intensity of 5 time points
around 800 after the flow has been switched on as the basal level
ERK activation for normalization. The Alexa546-dextran channel
was stacked and profiled through time to verify the accuracy of
temporally defined growth factor exposure in the cell chamber of
microfluidic device.
NS-1 differentiation experiments
Prior to the differentiation experiments in microfluidic devices, cells
were starved for 6 h. About 200ll of GF-containing medium was
then added to one of the input reservoirs (Fig 1C). To prevent evap-
oration, the cell inlet port was sealed using adhesive plastic. The
microfluidic devices were connected through a syringe connector to
an ONIX pressure pump (Millipore, USA). Differentiation experi-
ments were performed in a table-top small incubator with connec-
tion ports (Galaxy, Eppendorf). The output valve pressure was
stabilized at 1.5 psi and different constant or pulsatile protocols
were run. Each protocol included a 2-h adaptation time to flow in
starvation medium, followed by 13 h of sustained or pulsatile GF
exposure, which was determined by changing the opening sequence
of the computer-controlled pressure valve. Since there is a limitation
in number of valves that could be controlled independently, we
connected a 4-way conduit to each valve to maximize throughput.
This strategy allowed us to use 8 valves embedded in the pump to
process in 4 different microfluidic devices, ultimately allowing to
perform 16 experiments simultaneously. Each chamber from a
single microfluidic provided independent results for a given stimula-
tion pattern. For each experiment, a negative (no GF) and a positive
control (sustained stimulation with a GF) were included. After the
13-h GF stimulation period, devices were disconnected and incu-
bated for an additional 24 h in the incubator in starvation medium.
Cells were then fixed with PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde (fixing
solution). To access cells in the microfluidic device, 50ll of fixing
solution was dropped on the top of the cell inlet port, inducing flow
through the cell chamber. After 150 , cells were permeabilized using
PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 300 and blocked using PBS, 2% BSA in
PBS for 150 . Cells were then incubated with an anti-alpha-tubulin
(Sigma T9026, 1:1,000) antibody for 6 h, washed for 300 , and incu-
bated with an Alexa-546 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000)
and DAPI for 3 h. Samples were washed with PBS for 300 . DAPI and
Alexa-546 images were scanned and stitched for the whole surface
of each microfluidic lane using the Metamorph “scanslide acquisi-
tion” module. Identical immunofluorescence and imaging protocols
were used to perform phosphoERK (1:1,000, Sigma M8159) and
ERK2 (1:1,000, Sigma M7927) experiments. Secondary detection
was then performed using Alexa-488- and Alexa-561-labeled anti-
bodies.
Tubulin/DAPI-stained images from the differentiation experi-
ments were processed using the Metamorph “Neurite Outgrowth
Analysis” module (Universal Imaging). Fields of view in which a
too high cell density was observed were manually erased using a
mask. This allowed us to extract a number of metrics for each cell,
such as total and average length of neurite outgrowth, and the
number of neurites per cell. A segmented image with each cell
containing an identification tag was then exported to the CellProfiler
image analysis software (http://www.cellprofiler.org/) (Kamentsky
et al, 2011). This was used to compute the major axis length of an

ellipse fitted to the cell soma. Ultimately, this was used to
compute the fraction of differentiated cells with the criterion that a
cell was considered differentiated, when the total neurite
outgrowth was larger than the major axis length of the soma. It is
important to mention that our computer vision-based neurite
outgrowth segmentation approach was much more stringent than
classic “manual” evaluation using the human eye (von Kriegsheim
et al, 2009). A direct comparison of the quantification of the frac-
tion of differentiated cells between these different methods is
therefore not possible.
Modeling
Based on the scheme in Fig 5A, a dynamic model in terms of ordi-
nary differential equations was derived. This model is consistent
with established models in the literature (Kholodenko, 2000; von
Kriegsheimet al, 2009; Nakakukiet al, 2010), which were used to
compile parameter values used in this study. All phosphorylation
and de-phosphorylation parameters were chosen to fit our experi-
mental data, while adhering to biologically reasonable parameter
bounds. The half-life of DUSP protein and mRNA was set to 90 min,
which reflects the observed long-term decay in the measured ERK
activity trajectories and lies within the experimentally reported
range from 7.5 min to 4 h (Nakakukiet al, 2010; Bermudez et al,
2011; Cagnol & Rivard, 2013). EGF receptor internalization, recy-
cling, and degradation were modeled as a two-step process using
experimentally reported values for the internalization, degradation,
and recycling parameters (Huanget al, 2006; Sorkin & Duex, 2010).
The model was implemented and simulated by numerical integra-
tion in MATLAB. A detailed account of all reactions, equations, and
parameters is provided in Appendix Table S1.
Simulating possible alternative model structures
Because the dynamic behavior of a model depends on its parameter
values, adding or removing modules usually requires re-adjusting
some parameter values in order to fit the experimental data
(Conzelmannet al, 2004; Sauro & Kholodenko, 2004; Del Vecchio
et al, 2008; Saez-Rodriguezet al, 2008). Therefore, when adding or
removing a module, we analyzed a whole range of parameters
(Fig EV5). The process itself is best explained using an example:
Removing the feed-forward crosstalk from the negative feedback,
while keeping all parameters fixed means that the strength of
the feedback has changed. There is now a strong activation of the
negative feedback, resulting in only one ERK pulse in response to
multi-pulse EGF stimulation (Fig EV5B, panels on the right). Quite
clearly, this does not match our experimental data and we have to
allow for readjustments of the negative feedback parameters. Read-
justing k3 from 0.0286/min to 0.0045 min recovered the observed
response dynamics for low-dosage EGF stimulation (Fig EV5B,
panels in the center), and readjusting to 0.001 min recovered the
observed trajectories for EGF high (Fig EV5B, panels on the left).
However, no single parameter readjustment was able to explain
low and high EGF dosage conditions simultaneously. We can
conclude that the receptor crosstalk is required to explain all of
our data."
