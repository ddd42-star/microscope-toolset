Neurons exploit localmRNA translation and retrograde transport of transcription factors to regulate gene expression in response to
signaling events at distal neuronal ends. Whether epigenetic factors could also be involved in such regulation is not known. We report
that the mRNA encoding the high-mobility group N5 (HMGN5) chromatin binding protein localizes to growth cones of both neuron-
like cells and of hippocampal neurons, where it has the potential to be translated, and that HMGN5 can be retrogradely transported
into the nucleus along neurites. Loss of HMGN5 function induces transcriptional changes and impairs neurite outgrowth, while
HMGN5 overexpression induces neurite outgrowth and chromatin decompaction; these effects are dependent on growth cone local-
ization ofHmgn5mRNA. We suggest that the localization and local translation of transcripts coding for epigenetic factors couple the
dynamic neuronal outgrowth process with chromatin regulation in the nucleus.
T
he localization of mRNA coupled to local translation in axons
and dendrites constitutes an efﬁcient way for neuronal cells to
control gene expression at high spatial and temporal resolution
(1). High-throughput technologies have facilitated the identiﬁca-
tion of broad catalogues of mRNAs localized in axonal and den-
dritic compartments of neuronal cells (2).
The recent discovery of locally translated transcription factors
that are retrogradely transported to the nucleus to elicit transcrip-
tional programs controlling cell survival or death or speciﬁcation
of neuronal identity (3–7) has led to a new paradigm of neuronal
gene regulation. Local synthesis coupled to retrograde transport
of nuclear factors enables a constant cross talk between the cell
periphery and the nucleus, instructing transcriptional programs
in response to local cues (e.g., growth factors, neurotransmitters,
extracellular matrix, injury, etc.). In addition to mRNAs encoding
transcription factors, previous transcriptomic studies of puriﬁed
neuronal processes have identiﬁed several axonal mRNAs encod-
ing chromatin interacting and remodeling factors (8). However,
the relevance of the axonal localization and, possibly, the local
translation of such mRNAs have not been explored so far.
We previously identiﬁed/H1101180 mRNAs localizing to the extend-
ing neurites of neuron-like N1E-115 cells (9), a mouse neuroblas-
toma cell line widely used as anin vitrosystem to study neuronal
differentiation (10, 11). This model recapitulates the extension of
neurites before axon-dendrite speciﬁcation, which is the principal
morphological characteristic of early neuronal differentiation
(12). Using this model, we demonstrated that local mRNA trans-
lation not only is a feature of axons and dendrites but also occurs
at early neuronal differentiation stages (9).
Among theneurite-enriched mRNAs in N1E-115 cells, we iden-
tiﬁed transcripts encoding nuclear proteins (9). One of these mRNAs
encodes the high-mobility group N5 (HMGN5) chromatin binding
protein. HMGN proteins bind the nucleosome core particle and
compete with linker histone H1 for chromatin binding sites, there-
fore affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (13).
HMGN5 is the most recently characterized member of the HMGN
family. Its structure comprises an N-terminal nuclear localization sig-
nal, a nucleosome binding domain (NBD), and a C-terminal acidic
tail that is able to interact with the histone H1 C-terminal tail (14). In
animals with impaired HMGN5 function, the transcriptional proﬁles
of several organs, including brain, spleen, liver, and thymus, are af-
fected (15). Although little is known about HMGN5 physiological
functions, it has been suggested that HMGN5 might control cellular
differentiation, glutathione metabolism, tumor progression, and car-
diac function (14, 16, 17).
Here, we present evidence supporting a novel function of
HMGN5 in controlling neurite outgrowth and chromatin struc-
ture in both neuroblastoma cells and mouse hippocampal neu-
rons. We show thatHmgn5 mRNA growth cone localization is
important for neurite outgrowth, and we suggest that the local
synthesis coupled to retrograde transport of HMGN5 might serve
as a mechanism to inﬂuence chromatin structure and function in
response to signaling at distal neuronal ends.

previously described ( 9). For Hmgn5 knockdown (KD), cells were
transfected with 80 nM small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon
siRNA SMARTpool Plus or a single Dharmacon siRNA [J-044143-05]
for rescue experiments).
Neurite puriﬁcation, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR analysis.Puri-
ﬁcation of total RNA from soma and neurite fractions of N1E-115 cells
and reverse transcription (RT) were performed as previously described
(9). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the GoTaq qPCR
master mix (Promega) with the primers indicated in Table S1 in the sup-
plemental material.Rpl19 mRNA was used as a normalization control.
Relative quantiﬁcation was performed using the 2/H11002/H9004/H9004CT method (18).
Immunoﬂuorescence and Western blotting.N1E-115 cells and hip-
pocampal neurons were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 96 h posttransfection and at 3 daysin vitro (DIV3) or DIV7, respec-
tively, permeabilized, and stained as previously described (9). For West-
ern blot analysis, protein lysates were run on NuPAGE 4 to 12% Bis-Tris
gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) microporous membrane (Immobilon-FL), which was then incu-
bated with primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. After the membrane
was washed, the signal was revealed with the Amersham ECL Prime West-
ern blotting detection reagent by autoradiography.
FISH. Fluorescent in situhybridization (FISH) was performed as pre-
viously described (9) by using digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche),
antidigoxigenin antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Roche),
and tyramide-Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen). The primers used to generate
FISH probes are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material.
Microscopy, image acquisition, and analysis.Wide-ﬁeld microscopy
experiments were performed on an inverted Eclipse Ti microscope
(Nikon). Phase-contrast live imaging and Dendra2 photobleaching ex-
periments were previously described (9). For histone H1 and HMGN5
ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, bleach-
ing was performed with the 488-nm laser from a FRAP3D module (Roper
Scientiﬁc). A spot of/H110113 /H9262m in diameter was bleached with a 400-ms
bleach pulse, and recovery epiﬂuorescence images were collected in the
green channel every 3 s for 200 s (for histone H1 FRAP) or in streaming
mode for 26 s (for HMGN5 FRAP). Quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence recov-
ery was done as previously described (19). For photoconversion experi-
ments, distal neurites and growth cones of N1E-115 cells were photocon-
verted with a 1-s pulse of UV light (excitation ﬁlter, 377/50 nm; dichroic
mirror, 409 nm [using Leica EL6000 ﬂuorescence lamp]), and images
were taken every 10 s for 2 min in a Leica DMI 6000 B inverted microscope
in a temperature-controlled incubation chamber using the Leica Applica-
tion Suite software. Where indicated, cells were treated with 1 mM EHNA
[erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine] (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in
water 1 h before imaging. To assess the effectiveness of the EHNA treat-
ment, differentiated N1E-115 cells were treated with 20 nM LysoTracker
green DND-26 (Life Technologies) 20 min before imaging, medium was
changed, and images were taken every 5 s for 2.5 min with an inverted
Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon). To analyze neurite outgrowth, automated
neurite segmentation was performed using MetaMorph software or the
Simple Neurite Tracer plug-in of ImageJ. A neurite was deﬁned as a cell
process with a length of/H110221 cell body diameter. Quantiﬁcation of staining
or ﬂuorescent protein intensities and Western blot band intensities was
performed with either MetaMorph or ImageJ. Quantiﬁcation of the num-
ber of heterochromatic foci in 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-
stained nuclei was done using the Find Maxima process of ImageJ. Where
ﬂuorescence intensities are compared, images are all equally scaled. The
outcome of the ﬁrst repetition of many of the experiments (Fig. 4D, E, G,
and H and 5A and B) presented was assessed in a blinded fashion.
Statistical analysis.Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad
Prism 6 software. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare neu-
rite length distributions, while a paired or unpaired (according to the type
of experiment) two-tailedt test was used for parametric distributions.
Normality of the distributions was assessed with SPSS Statistics software
(IBM).
Primary neuron isolation, transfection, and culture. Mice were
maintained on a 12-h day-night cycle with adequate food and water under
speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions and according to Swiss federal regula-
tions under license number AF-ZH. The day of vaginal plug was consid-
ered embryonic day 0 (E0). Primary neurons were isolated from mouse
embryos at E18.5, transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector II system (6
/H9262g of plasmid DNA and/or 50 pmol of siRNA for 5/H11003106 to 10/H11003106 cells)
and analyzed at DIV3 or DIV7. Only green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-
positive cells were used for analysis. Neurons were cultured as previously
described (9).
Antibodies and plasmids. The following antibodies were used for
Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence: anti-/H9251tubulin (Sigma), anti-
H3K9me3 (Abcam), anti-GFP (Roche), antidoublecortin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-/H9252III tubulin (Abcam), anti-MAP2 (Millipore), anti-
SMI312 (Covance). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were from GE
Healthcare, while secondary Alexa Fluor ﬂuorophore-conjugated anti-
bodies were from Invitrogen. Anti-HMGN5 antibody was described pre-
viously (20). The PalX2-Dendra2 construct (21) was ﬂanked at the 3= end
with theHmgn5 3= untranslated region (UTR). The HMGN5-Dendra2-3=
UTR construct was generated by removing the palmitoylation sequence
and inserting theHmgn5 coding sequence 5= to Dendra2 and theHmgn5
3= UTR 3= to Dendra2. HMGN5 overexpression constructs were gener-
ated by cloning theHmgn5 coding sequence into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosci-
ences Clontech) at the 5= end of enhanced GFP (EGFP), whileHmgn5 3=
UTR was inserted at the 3= end of EGFP. Dendra2, GFP, and HMGN5-
GFP constructs bear the /H11011200-nucleotide 3= UTR derived from the
pEGFP-N1 vector. All constructs bear SV40 polyadenylation signal. The
Hmgn5coding sequence was made siRNA resistant by site-directed mu-
tagenesis. Overexpression and rescue constructs for primary neuron ex-
periments were obtained by subcloning sequences of HMGN5-EGFP-3=
UTR into the pCAG vector. For generating FISH probes, the 3=-UTR
sequence ofHmgn5 and the coding sequence of EGFP were cloned into
pBluescript II KS(/H11001//H11002) (Agilent Technologies). The EGFP-H1 construct
was described previously (22), while the HMGN5-mRuby2 expression
constructs were obtained by cloning the mRuby2 coding sequence in the
place of EGFP in the HMGN5-GFP expression constructs. All primers
used for cloning are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Plas-
mid maps are available upon request.
Microarray analysis. Microarray analysis of N1E-115 cells was per-
formed in triplicate. The cRNA target was synthesized and ampliﬁed using
the WT expression kit (Ambion) and then fragmented and biotin labeled
using the WT terminal labeling and control kit (Affymetrix) starting from
270 ng total RNA. For each sample, 12/H9262g of cRNA was used to generate
cDNA. For each sample, 3.75/H9262g of cDNA was fragmented. All synthesis
reactions were carried out in 0.2-ml tubes using a PCR machine (TPro-
fessional Trio; Biometra, Gottingen, Germany) to ensure the highest pos-
sible degree of temperature control. The hybridization cocktail containing
fragmented biotin-labeled target DNA at a ﬁnal concentration of 25 ng//H9262l
was transferred into the Affymetrix GeneChip mouse gene 2.0 ST array
(Affymetrix) and incubated at 45°C on a rotator in a hybridization oven
640 (Affymetrix) for 17 h at 60 rpm. The arrays were washed and stained
on a ﬂuidics station 450 (Affymetrix) by using the hybridization wash and
stain kit (Affymetrix) using ﬂuidics procedure FS450_0002. The
GeneChip products were processed with an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner
3000 7G (Affymetrix). DAT image ﬁles of the microarrays were generated
using the Affymetrix GeneChip command console (Affymetrix). Data
were imported into R (version 3.0.2; R Core Team) and normalized with
robust multiarray averaging (RMA) (23). For each Entrez gene, only one
probe set with the highest variance across the data set was selected (using
the geneﬁlter and annotation packages from Bioconductor repository ver-
sion 2.13 [24]). A moderated version of thet test (limma package) was
used to identify the differentially expressed genes. ObtainedP values were
corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.

Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins and mass spectrom-
etry analysis.A total of 1.5/H11003106 N1E-115 cells were transfected with the
GFP fusion constructs and differentiated on laminin-coated petri dishes.
Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged proteins was performed in triplicate
using the GFP-Trap_A kit (Chromotek) by following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted as previously de-
scribed (25) by using Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako). The mass spectrome-
try raw data were analyzed by the MaxQuant 1.3 software package. The
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra were searched against the
mouse UniProt database. Carbamylation (C) was selected as the ﬁxed
modiﬁcation. Variable modiﬁcations were phosphorylation (STY) and
oxidation (M).
Accession numbers. Proteomic data have been deposited in Pro-
teomeXchange (26) with accession number PXD001070. Microarray data
have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
with accession numberGSE57185.
RESULTS
Hmgn5 mRNA localizes to the growth cones of N1E-115 cells by
virtue of a 3=-UTR localization signal.In our previous microar-
ray analysis, we found mouseHmgn5 mRNA to be enriched in the
neurites of differentiated N1E-115 cells (9). These cells exhibit
neurite outgrowth in response to serum deprivation and laminin/
integrin signaling (27). We conﬁrmed the neurite enrichment of
Hmgn5 mRNA by performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-
PCR) on total RNA extracted from neurite and soma fractions of
differentiated N1E-115 cells (Fig. 1Aand B). As a quality control
for the neurite/soma puriﬁcation strategy, we evaluated the levels
of a noncoding RNA (snord15b) that in our previous analysis
showed a strong somatic enrichment (9). Fluorescentin situhy-
bridization (FISH) with riboprobes antisense toHmgn5 mRNA
showed thatHmgn5 mRNA localizes to bright punctate structures
in the growth cones of N1E-115 cells, similarly to other known
localized mRNAs (4, 9). This punctate pattern suggests the asso-
ciation of mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles (Fig. 1C,
black arrowheads), which have been proposed to be responsible
for regulating mRNA transport and/or translation (28). Such
punctate structures are also visible forHmgn5 mRNA in the soma
(Fig. 1C), where bulk protein synthesis usually occurs. The sense
control riboprobe displayed a lower and more diffuse signal than
the antisense probe and the absence of any punctate structure (Fig.
1C). Since the localization and translation of mRNAs are often
controlled by sequences residing in mRNA 3= untranslated re-
gions (UTRs) (29), we assessed whether the mouseHmgn5 3= UTR
contains a localization signal by fusing it to a GFP reporter and
performing FISH with a riboprobe antisense toGFP mRNA. Ap-
pending theHmgn5 3= UTR to theGFP mRNA recapitulated the
punctate growth cone localization pattern observed with endoge-
nousHmgn5 (Fig. 1D, black arrowheads; observed in 21/30
growth cones), while GFP mRNA without the Hmgn5 3= UTR
shows diffuse staining throughout the growth cone (Fig. 1D; ob-
served in 23/30 growth cones), suggesting no RNP association. As
observed withHmgn5 mRNA, punctate structures are visible for
GFP mRNA both with and without theHmgn5 3= UTR in the soma
(Fig. 1D). We concluded thatHmgn5 mRNA localizes to growth
cones of N1E-115 cells and that theHmgn5 3= UTR contains a
growth cone mRNA localization signal.
Hmgn53= UTR supports growth cone translation in N1E-115
cells. The 3= UTRs of localized mRNAs usually drive local mRNA
translation by virtue of their association with RNA binding pro-
teins (RBPs) (29–31). To assess whetherHmgn5 3= UTR can sup-
port local translation of a reporter mRNA, we fused it to a
Dendra2 reporter (PalX2-Dendra2–Hmgn5 3= UTR) that contains
two palmitoylation signals. This targets Dendra2 to the plasma
membrane and therefore limits its diffusion to 50/H9262m/h (32).
Thus, ﬂuorescent PalX2-Dendra2 signals arising in the growth
cone shortly after photobleaching reﬂect newly synthesized pro-
teins rather than protein transport from the soma (/H1102250 /H9262m away
from the bleached growth cone). Distal neurite segments of trans-
fected N1E-115 cells were bleached with intense green light, and
ﬂuorescence recovery was measured for 30 min. For each condi-
tion, only protruding growth cones were selected. A signiﬁcantly
higher ﬂuorescence recovery was observed for the PalX2-Den-
dra2–Hmgn5 3= UTR construct than for PalX2-Dendra2 (Fig. 2A
to C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material), while both
constructs showed similar expression levels before being bleached
(Fig. 2D). The ﬂuorescence recovery was dependent on new trans-
lation since it was abrogated by incubation with the translation
inhibitor anisomycin (Fig. 2A to C; see Movie S1 in the supple-
mental material). Thus, Hmgn5 3= UTR supports local mRNA
translation in distal neurite segments and growth cones of N1E-
115 cells.
HMGN5 can be retrogradely transported along neurites of
N1E-115 cells.As previously shown for locally synthesized CREB,
SMAD, STAT3, and ATF4 transcription factors (4–7), we hypoth-
esized that locally translated HMGN5 might be trafﬁcked back to
the cell nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we transfected N1E-115
cells with an HMGN5-Dendra2 fusion followed byHmgn5 3=
UTR. We then locally photoconverted Dendra2 (from green to
red) in distal neurite segments and growth cones (/H1102250 /H9262m away
from the soma) with UV light and monitored the nuclear accu-
mulation of the red signal over 2 min after photoconversion (Fig.
3A). We assumed that if HMGN5 is actively retrogradely trans-
ported along the neurites of N1E-115 cells, it should accumulate
in the nucleus faster than the Dendra2 protein alone by virtue of
passive diffusion, as shown for CREB and SMAD (4, 5). Consis-
tently, we observed an accumulation of nuclear red ﬂuorescence
when cells were transfected with HMGN5-Dendra2-3= UTR in
comparison to Dendra2 alone (Fig. 3Band C). Nuclei belonging
to cells that did not undergo photoconversion but were located in
the same ﬁeld of view as the photoconverted nuclei (white arrow-
heads inFig. 3B) were used as controls for nonspeciﬁc nuclear
photoconversion during imaging of Dendra2 or HMGN5-
Dendra2-3= UTR (Fig. 3Band C). Treatment with the dynein in-
hibitor EHNA abolished the accumulation of nuclear red ﬂuores-
cence, demonstrating that HMGN5 retrograde transport occurs
via dynein motor proteins (Fig. 3D), as previously reported for the
transcription factors SMAD and STAT3 (5, 6). The effectiveness of
the EHNA treatment in abolishing retrograde transport was con-
ﬁrmed by assessing the movement of acidic organelles using the
LysoTracker dye (see Movies S2 and S3 and Fig. S1 in the supple-
mental material). These data indicate that HMGN5 can be retro-
gradely transported from the neurite to the nucleus of N1E-115
cells.
Hmgn5 KD causes transcriptional changes and impairs neu-
rite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells.Since HMGN5 modulates the
transcriptome of different cell types and organs (15, 33), we per-
formed transcriptome analysis of N1E-115 cells transfected with
Hmgn5small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and compared them to
N1E-115 cells transfected with control (ctrl) siRNAs. To identify
transcripts speciﬁcally linked to neurite outgrowth, we ﬁrst differ-

Hmgn5 mRNA Localization Controls Neurite Outgrowth

rial). We found that 31 genes were signiﬁcantly affected byHmgn5
KD (see Fig. S2A, column “kd vs ctrl,” in the supplemental mate-
rial), and we conﬁrmed the microarray results by qRT-PCR (see
Fig. S2B). Among these 31 genes, 18 were also affected by the
extent of neurite outgrowth (see Fig. S2A, column “4 h vs 24 h”).
Interestingly, all of these genes except one showed matching
changes inHmgn5 KD and the extent of neurite outgrowth (i.e.,
genes downregulated uponHmgn5 KD were also less expressed in
cells exhibiting short compared to long neurites). We also noticed
thatHmgn5 KD inﬂuences the expression of genes (e.g., Pltp,
Adam12, Prkg1, Plxna4, Capn6, Cnn2, septin3) that are known to
be involved in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics (34–40).
These ﬁndings led us to test whether HMGN5 controls the
neurite outgrowth process in N1E-115 cells. We found that
Hmgn5KD causes an/H1101140% reduction of neurite length in N1E-
115 cells (Fig. 4Dand E). In these cells, neurite outgrowth is ﬁrst
characterized by an initial stage where multiple neurites stochas-
tically protrude and retract, followed by the stabilization of one or
two neurites that grow continuously (41). Phase-contrast time-
lapse analysis revealed thatHmgn5 KD cells displayed repeated
collapse events and had difﬁculties in establishing steady neurite
outgrowth (Fig. 4F; see also Movie S4 in the supplemental mate-
rial). To evaluate whether the growth cone mRNA localization
and translation ofHmgn5 mRNA are important for the regulation
of neurite outgrowth, we rescued the KD phenotype by reexpress-
ing different siRNA-resistant versions of HMGN5. The HMGN5-
GFP constructs contain onlyHmgn5 coding sequence (CDS)
fused to GFP and will solely lead to somatic translation. In con-
trast, the HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR constructs contain alsoHmgn5 3=
UTR and will additionally localize and be translated in the growth
cone (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). We found that
only HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR was able to fully rescue the neurite
outgrowth defect caused byHmgn5 KD (Fig. 4Gto H), indicating
that properHmgn5 mRNA localization is required for the regula-
tion of neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. To explore the exis-
tence of potential HMGN5 functions other than its chromatin
binding function, we mutated two residues in the HMGN5
nucleosome binding domain (NBD) that are known to mediate
chromatin binding (serines 17 and 21 mutated to glutamic acids,
hence named the S17,21E mutant). HMGN5S17,21E mutants
have been previously shown to no longer be able to bind the
nucleosome core particle (42). HMGN5S17,21E-GFP-3= UTR
failed to rescue the KD phenotype, indicating that HMGN5 func-
tion in N1E-115 cells is exerted through its binding to chromatin
(Fig. 4G to H). The expression levels of the different HMGN5-
GFP constructs were approximately equal (see Fig. S3B in the
supplemental material), suggesting that the observed effects were
exclusively due to the molecular properties of the exogenously
expressed proteins. These results show that both HMGN5 chro-
matin binding function andHmgn5 mRNA growth cone localiza-
tion are important for the modulation of neurite outgrowth in
N1E-115 cells.
HMGN5 stimulates neurite outgrowth and modulates chro-
matin dynamics in N1E-115 cells in a 3=-UTR-dependent man-
ner. We next overexpressed the various HMGN5 fusion con-
structs in N1E-115 cells. Opposite to what we observed upon KD,
the overexpression of HMGN5 increased neurite outgrowth by
/H1101130%, and this effect was dependent both on the proper growth
cone localization and on the chromatin binding function of the
exogenously expressed mRNA and protein (Fig. 5Aand B). Since
the chromatin binding activity of HMGN5 is required for neurite
outgrowth, we analyzed the effect of HMGN5 overexpression on
chromatin structure and dynamics. HMGN5 overexpression in
ﬁbroblasts, U2OS cells, 293T cells, and a mouse pituitary cell line
triggers global chromatin decompaction, as revealed by DAPI and
heterochromatin marker staining (42). To evaluate chromatin
structure, we used DAPI staining and quantitated the number of
heterochromatic foci. We found that HMGN5-mediated chroma-
tin decompaction (i.e., reduction or disappearance of dense het-
erochromatic foci) was strictly dependent on growth cone local-
ization ofHmgn5 mRNA (Fig. 5Cand D; see also Fig. S4A and B
in the supplemental material). Similarly, overexpression of
HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR but not HMGN5-GFP caused a reduction
of H3K9me3 heterochromatic foci and a decrease in H3K9me3
focal staining intensity (Fig. 5C and E), indicating a rearrange-
ment of heterochromatin. Fluorescence recovery after photo-
bleaching (FRAP) and cross-linking experiments have previously
revealed that HMGN5 interacts with linker histone H1 and re-
duces its binding to chromatin (22, 42). To test whether this was
also the case in N1E-115 cells, we performed FRAP experiments
on cells expressing both histone H1-GFP and HMGN5 (Fig. 6; see
Movie S5 in the supplemental material). We observed that only
the HMGN5-mRuby2-3= UTR construct was able to inﬂuence the
mobility of histone H1 (by decreasing its chromatin residency
time, thus accelerating its ﬂuorescence recovery [Fig. 6Cand D]),
while the HMGN5-mRuby2 construct did not have any effect (Fig.
6C and D). This implies that HMGN5-mRuby2-3= UTR is more
efﬁcient in counteracting histone H1-mediated chromatin com-
paction than HMGN5-mRuby2. Taken together, our DAPI/
H3K9me3 staining and FRAP experiments indicate that growth
cone-translated and retrogradely transported HMGN5 inﬂuences
chromatin structure and dynamics in N1E-115 cells.
Hmgn5 mRNA localization affects HMGN5 NBD phosphor-
ylation and chromatin residency time.Locally translated pro-
teins might be endowed with different biochemical properties
than their cell body-translated counterparts (1). Since the func-
tion of HMGN proteins is regulated by posttranslational modiﬁ-
cations such as phosphorylation and acetylation (43), we hypoth-
esized that locally synthesized HMGN5 might bear different
posttranslational modiﬁcations compared to the protein synthe-
sized in the soma. To test this hypothesis, we performed GFP
immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis of
cell lysates expressing either HMGN5-GFP or HMGN5-GFP-3=
UTR constructs (Fig. 7A). The HMGN5 protein synthesized from
the construct bearingHmgn5 3= UTR showed 7-fold-higher levels
of phosphorylation of serines 17 and 21 in the NBD with respect to
HMGN5 synthesized from a somatic mRNA (Fig. 7B and C).
Other phosphorylation sites outside the NBD were not signiﬁ-
cantly affected. Since phosphorylation of HMGN NBD has been
shown to affect HMGN afﬁnity for the nucleosome core particle
and for other interactors (13, 44), we performed a FRAP analysis
to measure intranuclear mobility of HMGN5-GFP expressed
from somatically or growth cone-translated mRNAs (HMGN5-
GFP or HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR) (42). HMGN5-GFP showed a
faster recovery of ﬂuorescence after photobleaching than
HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR, indicating that HMGN5 synthesized from
a growth cone localizing mRNA has a higher chromatin residency
time (Fig. 7D and E). A comparable difference in the extent of
ﬂuorescence recovery (/H1101110%) was previously observed for mouse
HMGN5 mutants showing different chromatin binding afﬁnities,

supporting the physiological relevance of the magnitude of the
effect we observe in N1E-115 cells (22). These results suggest that
growth cone mRNA localization and translation inﬂuence
HMGN5 phosphorylation and chromatin binding properties to
regulate neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells.
Hmgn5 mRNA localization controls neurite outgrowth and

gated Hmgn5 mRNA localization and protein function in mouse
hippocampal neurons, a well-known system to study neuronal
outgrowth and the establishment of neuronal polarity (45). In
culture, the round shape of dissected neurons is rapidly broken
and several neurites are sequentially established. These neurites
extend as the cells differentiate and, after 7 days, a single axon and
several dendrites can be observed (12, 45). FISH analysis revealed

localization of Hmgn5 mRNA in growth cones of hippocampal
neurons at 3 daysin vitro(DIV3) and showed thatHmgn5 3= UTR
functions as a growth cone localization element in this cell system
(Fig. 8A; see also Fig. S5, arrowheads, in the supplemental mate-
rial). Hmgn5 KD in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 8Band C) led to
reduced neurite length at DIV3 (Fig. 8Dand E). Since only a small
proportion of neurons (/H1101110%) showed clear axon/dendrite spec-
iﬁcation at DIV3 in our hands, we referred to all cell processes with
a length over 1 cell body diameter as “neurites.” TheHmgn5 KD
phenotype was rescued by exogenous HMGN5 expression only
when theHmgn5 3= UTR was present in the expression construct
(Fig. 8D and E). Using antineuroﬁlament SMI312 staining, no
defect in axonal speciﬁcation at either DIV3 (for the small per-
centage of neurons that already present an axon at this stage) or
DIV7 was observed, indicating that HMGN5 might function ex-
clusively as a regulator of neurite length and not of axonal speci-
ﬁcation (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). To explore
whether HMGN5 is able to modify chromatin structure in hip-
pocampal neurons, we overexpressed the different HMGN5 con-
structs. Only HMGN5-GFP-3= UTR was able to induce a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant increase in neurite length in hippocampal
neurons (Fig. 9Aand B) and chromatin decompaction and reor-
ganization, as quantiﬁed by counting the number of heterochro-
matic foci and the average staining intensity of H3K9me3 foci
(Fig. 9C to E). We conclude that, as observed in N1E-115 cells,
Hmgn5 mRNA growth cone localization and HMGN5 function
are involved in modulating neurite outgrowth and chromatin
compaction in hippocampal neurons.

signaling events, such as growth factor application to growth
cones, to transcriptional changes in the nucleus (8). Transcripts
encoding chromatin regulators have also been identiﬁed in axonal
terminals, but whether their proper localization and function are
involved in such a growth cone-to-nucleus signaling program in
neuronal development has not been explored. Importantly, regu-
lation of higher-order chromatin architecture has been shown to
play a key role in controlling gene expression during neuronal
development (46). Here, we show that the growth cone localiza-

both neuroblastoma cells and primary hippocampal neurons
(Fig. 4, 5, 8, and9). Both the rescue of the KD and the overexpres-
sion phenotypes are strictly dependent on (i) the presence of
Hmgn53= UTR in the expression construct (Fig. 4, 5, 8, and 9),
which is able to support growth cone localization (Fig. 1D; see also
Fig. S3A and S4 in the supplemental material) and translation
(Fig. 2), and (ii) the chromatin binding ability of HMGN5 (Fig. 4
and 5). These results strengthen previous observations showing
the importance of proper subcellular mRNA localization for both
initial neurite (9) and later axonal (47, 48) outgrowth.
While indications of possible neurological functions have been
ascribed to HMGN1 and HMGN3 (49–51), HMGN5 has not been
implicated in brain physiology so far. Loss of HMGN5 function in
the brain induces transcriptional changes in genes implicated in
nervous system development and cell morphogenesis (15). As ob-
served for HMGN1 (49), we also detect high HMGN5 expression
levels in neurogenic areas of the mouse brain (F. Moretti and C.
Rolando, unpublished observations). Furthermore,Hmgn5
mRNA has been detected in preparations from the synaptic neu-
ropil (52). These observations suggest anin vivorole of HMGN5
in neuronal differentiation, which awaits further characterization.
In neuron-like N1E-115 cells, transcriptional proﬁling reveals that
Hmgn5KD affects the expression of 31 genes, many of which are
involved in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics (see Fig. S2A in
the supplemental material). Furthermore, many of these genes are
also temporally modulated during the neurite outgrowth process
(see Fig. S2A). These ﬁndings suggest a role for HMGN5 in tran-
scriptional regulation of cytoskeleton-regulating genes during the
neuronal outgrowth process, a possibility that is in agreement
with the inability ofHmgn5 KD cells to extend stable neurites (see
Movie S4 in the supplemental material).
The transcriptional changes observed uponHmgn5 KD might
be a direct consequence of HMGN5-mediated chromatin struc-
ture rearrangements. Indeed, in line with previous observations in
different cell types (22, 42), we show that HMGN5 overexpression
affects chromatin structure in both neuroblastoma cells as well as
hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5and 9). Speciﬁcally, HMGN5 over-
expression leads to chromatin decompaction (Fig. 5 and 9) and
reduced linker histone H1 binding to chromatin, as evidenced by
the decrease in its chromatin residence time (Fig. 6). These phe-
notypes strictly depend on growth cone localization ofHmgn5
mRNA (Fig. 5, 6, and9). We ﬁnd that HMGN5 synthesized from
an mRNA that is locally translated in the growth cone is exten-
sively phosphorylated at serines 17 and 21 in its NBD in compar-
ison to somatically synthesized HMGN5 (Fig. 7Band C). Consis-
tently with the NBD being the major determinant of the
interaction of HMGN proteins with the nucleosome core particle,
and with this interaction being speciﬁcally regulated by Ser17/21
phosphorylation (13, 44), our FRAP analysis indicates that growth
cone-synthesized, phosphorylated HMGN5 has a higher chroma-
tin residency time than its somatically synthesized counterpart
(Fig. 7Dand E). We therefore propose that phosphorylation-in-
duced, tighter chromatin binding of growth cone-synthesized
HMGN5 enables the regulation of chromatin dynamics necessary
to control transcriptional programs impinging on neurite out-
growth. To further investigate the signiﬁcance of HMGN5 NBD
phosphorylation, which is strictly conserved among HMGN fam-
ily members, the use of phosphomimetic point mutants would be
of great help. However, in the context of HMGN proteins, there
are several limitations inherent to this approach. In HMGN1,
Ser17/21 phosphorylation also modulates its interaction with 14-
3-3 proteins involved in multiple intracellular targeting processes
(44). Thus, HMGN5 NBD phosphorylation might regulate not
only HMGN5 chromatin binding afﬁnity but also additional reg-
ulatory steps. Furthermore, at least for HMGN1, phosphomi-
metic mutants have been shown not to fully behave as their phos-
phorylated counterparts (44), and both phosphomimetic and
conservative amino acid substitutions abolish chromatin binding
(53). Overall, the inability of the HMGN5S17,21E mutant to
modulate neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4Gand H and 5A and B) sug-
gests that HMGN5 NBD phosphorylation might play an impor-
tant role in neuronal differentiation, which awaits further charac-
terization.
What is the signiﬁcance of the requirement of such a complex
spatiotemporal signaling mechanism that involves (i) transport of
Hmgn5mRNA to the growth cone, (ii) local translation, and (iii)
retrograde HMGN5 transport to the nucleus?In vitro, the neuro-
nal differentiation process is highly stochastic and involves suc-
cessive cycles of neurite outgrowth and collapse that occur on
timescales of hours (see Movie S4 in the supplemental material)
(12). As proposed before (54), cell-intrinsic mechanisms must
exist to coordinate such a dynamic neurite outgrowth process
with protein synthesis through regulation of transcription. We
therefore hypothesize that the spatiotemporal regulation of
HMGN5 function might be part of a mechanism that links cell
morphodynamics with the control of transcription through
chromatin regulation at relevant time scales. Interestingly, sev-
eral other mRNAs encoding chromatin regulators have been
identiﬁed in axons of different neuronal subtypes. These in-
clude, for example, those for additional members of the high-
mobility group protein family (e.g.,Hmgb1, Hmgb2, Hmgn1,
Hmgn2, andHmgn3), members of the SWI/SNF chromatin re-
modeling complex (e.g., Smarca2 , Smarca5 , and Arid1a ), and
histone-modifying enzymes (e.g., Jmjdc1a , Jmjdc1c , Ash1l, and
Fbxl10 )( 8). Furthermore, a recent study identiﬁed mRNAs
encoding different histone H4 variants localized in dendrites of
CA1 pyramidal neurons (55). This suggests that modulation of
chromatin structure and function via local translation and ret-
rograde transport of epigenetic regulators might constitute a
general growth cone-to-nucleus signaling mechanism during
neuronal development. Our results thus pave the way for the
characterization of additional chromatin binding proteins that
might be locally synthesized in neuronal processes.
