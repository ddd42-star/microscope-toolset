Abstract
Combining single-cell measurements of ERK activity dynamics with
perturbations provides insights into the MAPK network topology.
We built circuits consisting of an optogenetic actuator to activate
MAPK signaling and an ERK biosensor to measure single-cell ERK
dynamics. This allowed us to conduct RNAi screens to investigate
the role of50 MAPK proteins in ERK dynamics. We found that the
MAPK network is robust against most node perturbations. We
observed that the ERK-RAF and the ERK-RSK2-SOS negative feed-
back operate simultaneously to regulate ERK dynamics. Bypassing
the RSK2-mediated feedback, either by direct optogenetic activa-
tion of RAS, or by RSK2 perturbation, sensitized ERK dynamics to
further perturbations. Similarly, targeting this feedback in a
human ErbB2-dependent oncogenic signaling model increased the
efficiency of a MEK inhibitor. The RSK2-mediated feedback is thus
important for the ability of the MAPK network to produce consis-
tent ERK outputs, and its perturbation can enhance the efficiency
of MAPK inhibitors.

Introduction
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is part of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling network and
regulates a large variety of fate decisions. While ERK can be acti-
vated by several extracellular inputs, ERK signaling has mostly been
studied in the context of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Upon
binding of their cognate growth factors (GFs), RTKs activate a com-
plex signaling cascade with the following hierarchy: (i) recruitment
of adaptor molecules such as GRB2 (Schlessinger,2000); (ii) control
of the activity of RAS GTPases through Guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs)
(Cherfils & Zeghouf,2013); (iii) triggering of a tripartite RAF, MEK,
ERK kinase cascade that is further regulated by a variety of binding
proteins (Lavoieet al, 2020); and (iv) ERK-mediated phosphoryla-
tion of a large number of substrates. Due to its central role in fate
decisions, MAPK network dysregulation is causative for a large
number of diseases including cancer (Rauen,2013; Samatar & Pouli-
kakos, 2014).
As for other signaling pathways (Purvis & Lahav,2013), tempo-
ral patterns of ERK activity, hereafter referred to as ERK dynamics,
rather than steady-state control fate decisions (Santoset al, 2007;
Avraham & Yarden, 2011; Albeck et al, 2013; Ryu et al, 2015).
These specific ERK dynamics have been shown to arise from feed-
back in the MAPK network. For example, a negative feedback (NFB)
from ERK to RAF can produce adaptive or oscillatory ERK dynamics
(Santoset al, 2007; Kholodenko et al, 2010; Avraham & Yarden,
2011). The ERK-RAF NFB was also shown to buffer against MAPK
node perturbations (Sturm et al, 2010; Fritsche-Guenther et al,
2011). This property might allow cells to produce consistent ERK
outputs despite heterogeneous node expression (Bl €uthgen &
Legewie, 2013). In this work, we specifically refer to the ability of
the MAPK network to produce consistent ERK dynamics in presence
of node perturbations as signaling robustness. While several NFBs
have been mapped experimentally in the MAPK network (Lakeet al,
2016), their contribution to this signaling robustness and shaping
ERK dynamics remains largely unknown.
Single-cell biosensor imaging has provided new insights into
MAPK signaling that were not accessible with biochemical,
population-averaged measurements. This showed that the MAPK
network can produce a wide variety of ERK dynamics such as tran-
sient (Ryuet al, 2015), pulsatile (Albeck et al, 2013), oscillatory
(Shankaran et al, 2009), and sustained dynamics (Ryuet al, 2015;
Blum et al, 2019). Mathematical modeling has provided insights
into the network’s structures that decode different signaling inputs
into specific ERK dynamics (Santoset al, 2007; Shankaran et al,

2009; Nakakuki et al, 2010; Ryu et al, 2015). Combined modeling/
experimental approaches helped to shed light on various subparts of
the MAPK network, including the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) module (Koseska & Bastiaens,2020), the RAS module
(Schmick et al, 2015;E r i c k s o net al, 2019), and the tripartite RAF/
MEK/ERK cascade (Ferrell & Bhatt,1997; Kholodenko, 2000; Orton
et al, 2005; Santos et al, 2007; Ryu et al, 2015; Kochan´czyk et al,
2017; Arkun & Yasemi, 2018). However, the low experimental
throughput to measure ERK dynamics, or other MAPK network nodes,
has precluded a global understanding of the specific functions of the
nodes present in the network.
Here, we built multiple genetic circuits consisting of optogenetic
actuators together with an ERK biosensor to simultaneously activate
ERK from different nodes in the MAPK network and report single-
cell ERK dynamics. These circuits allowed us to investigate the role
of 50 MAPK signaling nodes in ERK dynamics regulations with RNA
interference (RNAi). We observed that most perturbations of indi-
vidual nodes resulted in mild ERK dynamics phenotypes despite
targeting major MAPK signaling nodes. Further, the ERK dynamics
induced by various perturbations suggest that two NFBs (ERK-RAF
and ERK-RSK2-SOS) act simultaneously to regulate ERK dynamics.
Targeting the RSK2-mediated NFB increased the efficiency of addi-
tional MAPK network perturbations both in our optogenetic systems
and in an ErbB2-driven oncogenic ERK signaling model. This sug-
gests that the RSK2-mediated feedback plays a role in MAPK signal-
ing robustness and can be targeted for potent inhibition of
oncogenic ERK signaling.
Results
An optogenetic actuator–biosensor genetic circuit to study
input-dependent ERK dynamics
In order to measure ERK dynamics in response to dynamic RTK
input, we built a genetically encoded circuit made of an optogenetic
RTK actuator and an ERK biosensor (Fig1A). We chose optoFGFR,
which consists of a myristoylated intracellular domain of the fibro-
blast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) fused to a CRY2 domain and
tagged with mCitrine (Kimet al, 2014). Upon stimulation with blue
light, optoFGFR dimerizes and trans-autophosphorylates, leading to
the activation of the MAPK/ERK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT, and phospholipase C (PLC)/Ca2+ pathways. As ERK biosensor,
we used ERK-KTR-mRuby2 that is spectrally compatible with
optoFGFR. ERK-KTR reversibly translocates from the nucleus to the
cytosol upon ERK activation (Regotet al, 2014). We used a nuclear
Histone 2B (H2B)-miRFP703 marker to identify and track single
cells. After stably inserting these constructs into murine NIH3T3
fibroblasts, we used automated time-lapse microscopy to stimulate
selected fields of view with defined blue light input patterns to acti-
vate optoFGFR. The corresponding ERK-KTR/H2B signals were
recorded with a 1-min temporal resolution. We observed that a 100-
ms light pulse leads to reversible ERK-KTR translocation from the
nucleus to the cytosol, indicative of transient ERK activation (Fig1
B, Movie EV1). At the end of each experiment, we imaged the
mCitrine signal to evaluate optoFGFR expression levels. We built a
computer vision pipeline to automatically track each nucleus, com-
pute ERK activity as the cytosolic/nuclear ratio of the ERK-KTR
signals, and correlate single-cell ERK responses with optoFGFR
levels (Fig1C). We then use this pipeline to evaluate the sensitivity
and specificity of our system with dose–response experiments using
the FGFR inhibitor SU5402, the RAF inhibitor RAF709, the MEK
inhibitor U0126, and the ERK inhibitor SCH772984
(Appendix FigS1A).
To evaluate light-dependent optoFGFR activation dynamics, we
engineered a mScarlet-tagged optoFGFR that is spectrally orthogonal
to CRY2 absorption (Appendix FigS1B). Total internal reflection
(TIRF) microscopy visualized the formation of optoFGFR clusters in
response to blue light-mediated dimerization in the plasma mem-
brane (Appendix FigS1B, blue arrows, Movie EV2). Consistently
with CRY2’s dissociation half-life (Duan et al, 2017), these
optoFGFR clusters appeared within 20 s after a blue light pulse and
disappeared after~5 min (Appendix Fig S1C). We assume that
optoFGFR is active in its clustered form in which transphosphoryla-
tion occurs and inactive in its monomeric form due to tonic cyto-
solic phosphatase activity (Lemmonet al, 2016). As documented
previously (Kim et al, 2014), light stimulation also triggered
optoFGFR endocytosis (Appendix FigS1B, red arrows).
Directly following light stimulation, we systematically observed a
short ERK inactivation period, that we refer to as “dip”, lasting 2–
3 min before activation of a strong ERK activity (Appendix FigS1D,
green rectangle). This light-induced ERK dip was insensitive to
SCH772984-mediated ERK inhibition but could be suppressed by cyclo-
sporine A-mediated calcineurin inhibition. Calcineurin is a Ca2+-
dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser383 in Elk1 (Sugi-
motoet al, 1997). As ERK-KTR contains an Elk-1 docking domain
phosphorylated by ERK (Regotet al, 2014), we hypothesized that it
could be negatively affected by optoFGFR-evoked Ca2+ input (Kimet
al, 2014)( A p p e n d i xF i gS1E). Consistently, Ionomycin-evoked increase
in cytosolic Ca2+ induced a dip in absence of light stimulation (Appen-
dix FigS1F).
Different optoFGFR inputs trigger transient, oscillatory, and
sustained ERK dynamics
Next, we characterized optoFGFR-triggered ERK dynamics in
response to a single light pulse of different intensities and durations
(Fig2A). As ERK dynamics depended on light power density, as
well as pulse duration, we defined the light dose (D, mJ/cm2)a s
their product to quantify the total energy received per illuminated
area. To characterize ERK dynamics, we extracted the amplitude at
the maximum of the peak (maxPeak), and the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the ERK trajectories (Fig2B). With increasing
light doses, ERK peaks increased both in duration and amplitude,
until the latter reached saturation. Based on these observations, we
selected 180 mW/cm2 and 100 ms (D= 18 mJ/cm2) as the minimal
light input to generate an ERK transient of maximal amplitude.
Using this light dose, we then investigated ERK dynamics in
response to multiple light pulses delivered at different intervals
(Fig2C). All stimulation regimes led to identical maximal ERK
amplitude (FigEV1A) and adaptation kinetics when optoFGFR input
ceased (Fig EV1B). Repeated light inputs applied at 10- or 20-min
intervals evoked population-synchronous ERK transients. By con-
trast, repeated light inputs applied at higher frequencies (2-min
intervals) led to sustained ERK dynamics. Given CRY2’s 5-min
dissociation half-life (Appendix FigS1B and C) (Duan et al, 2017),

this suggests that light pulses delivered at a 2-min interval reactivate
optoFGFR faster than it deactivates, leading to sustained optoFGFR
activity. Hierarchical clustering of ERK responses to sustained
optoFGFR input highlighted the presence of sustained and oscilla-
tory single-cell ERK dynamics (Fig2D). Classification of ERK trajec-
tories based on optoFGFR expression revealed that sustained/
oscillatory ERK dynamics correlated with high/low optoFGFR levels
(Fig2E, Movie EV3). Oscillatory ERK dynamics were also observed
in optoFGFR high expressing cells in response to low light input
(Fig2F). Thus, sustained optoFGFR input can trigger sustained or
oscillatory ERK dynamics depending on the input strength, a combi-
nation of light energy and optoFGFR expression.
ERK dynamics evoked by optoFGFR versus endogenous RTKs
highlight different MAPK regulatory mechanisms
Because of the absence of an ectodomain, optoFGFR must be con-
sidered as a prototypic RTK that lacks some regulatory mechanisms
inherent to the native FGFR. To evaluate whether optoFGFR is
relevant for studying the MAPK network, we compared ERK dynam-
ics evoked by optoFGFR inputs versus stimulation of the endoge-
nous FGFR or EGFR using increasing concentrations of basic FGF
(bFGF) and EGF. All bFGF concentrations led to an ERK peak simi-
lar in amplitude to sustained optoFGFR input (Figs3A and EV1C,
compared to EV1A). However, FGFR inputs led to different ERK
dynamics than optoFGFR: 1 ng/ml bFGF led to damped ERK oscilla-
tions followed by steady-state sustained ERK activity, while 10 and
100 ng/ml bFGF concentrations led to a first ERK peak followed by
a strong adaptation. The biphasic behavior induced by increasing
bFGF concentrations was previously documented to emerge from
the competition of bFGF for FGFR and heparan sulfate proteoglycan
co-receptors (Kanodiaet al, 2014; Blum et al, 2019). It is thus not
surprising that optoFGFR, that lacks these extracellular interactions,
produced different ERK dynamics than FGFR. All EGF concentra-
tions led to an ERK peak similar in amplitude to optoFGFR and
FGFR inputs (Figs3B and EV1D). As for bFGF, 1 ng/ml EGF concen-
tration evoked damped oscillatory ERK dynamics that decreased at
higher EGF concentrations. However, EGFR inputs led to strong

ERK adaptation, not observed in response to optoFGFR inputs,
suggesting the existence of different regulatory mechanisms.
Both oscillatory and transient ERK dynamics can be explained by
the presence of NFB (Kholodenkoet al, 2010). Thus, we wondered
if the different ERK dynamics induced by optoFGFR or EGFR input
emerge from differences in downstream NFBs. We reasoned that if
EGFR induces different NFBs than optoFGFR, pre-stimulating cells
with EGF should activate this feedback, and affect subsequent
optoFGFR-evoked ERK dynamics. To test this, we pre-stimulated
cells with sustained EGFR input, subsequently applied sustained

optoFGFR input, and evaluated ERK dynamics (Fig 3C). Pre-
stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF led to the characteristic adaptive
ERK transient. Subsequent application of optoFGFR input yielded
sustained ERK responses similar in amplitude and duration to non-
pre-stimulated cells. However, EGF pre-stimulation led to a reduc-
tion of synchronous optoFGFR-evoked ERK oscillations in low
optoFGFR-expressing cells.
To provide intuition about the MAPK network circuitries leading
to different ERK dynamics in response to optoFGFR and EGFR
inputs, as well as the origin of the oscillatory behavior, we built a
mathematical model consisting of the RAS GTPase and the three-
tiered RAF/MEK/ERK network (Fig3D, Appendix Table S1). We
used ordinary differential equations with Michaelis-Menten kinetics
(see Materials and Methods, Appendix TableS2 and S3 ). To
account for the oscillatory ERK dynamics in response to EGFR and
optoFGFR inputs, we included the well-documented ERK-RAF NFB
(Santoset al, 2007; Kholodenkoet al, 2010; Fritsche-Guentheret al,
2011; Blum et al, 2019). We also included a receptor-level inactiva-
tion process for EGFR, but not for optoFGFR, to account for EGF-
dependent regulatory mechanisms. We used a Bayesian inference
approach (Mikelson & Khammash,2020) to infer the model parame-
ters from averaged ERK trajectories in response to sustained low
optoFGFR input with or without sustained EGFR pre-stimulation
(Fig3E). After identification of parameters that allowed the model
to capture the training dataset (Fig3F), we simulated ERK dynamics
evoked by low EGFR input (adaptative, oscillatory ERK dynamics),
high EGFR input (adaptative ERK dynamics without oscillation),
and sustained high optoFGFR input (sustained ERK dynamics)
(Fig3G). We observed that our model with a NFB and EGFR inacti-
vation was able to predict ERK dynamics evoked by different EGFR
and optoFGFR input strengths, while two simpler models (one with
only the EGFR inactivation reaction, but no NFB (FigEV1E–G) and
one with only the NFB, but no EGFR inactivation (FigEV1H–J) were
not able to reproduce experimentally observed ERK dynamics.
This suggested that oscillatory optoFGFR-evoked ERK dynamics
emerge from a NFB also present downstream of endogenous EGFR,
while additional regulatory mechanisms seem to be required for the
strong ERK transient adaptation following EGFR input. These mech-
anisms might consist of receptor-level regulations such as endocyto-
sis, which was recently shown to be an important regulator of the
transient adaptive EGF-triggered ERK dynamics in different cell sys-
tems (Gerosaet al, 2020; Kiyatkinet al, 2020). While optoFGFR also
gets endocytosed (Appendix FigS1B, Kimet al, 2014), it most likely
is insensitive to inactivation by endosome acidification since it lacks
an ectodomain (Huotari & Helenius,2011). Additionally, light-
mediated optoFGFR dimerization might occur both at the plasma
and endo-membranes, allowing for reactivation of endocytosed
optoFGFR. The hypothesis that a receptor-level mechanism is
important for strong adaptation was further supported by inhibition
of optoFGFR with the FGFR kinase inhibitor (SU5402), which
shifted ERK dynamics from sustained to transient in a dose
response-dependent manner (FigEV1K). Thus, these results suggest
that optoFGFR lacks receptor-dependent regulatory mechanisms but
allows us to investigate the intracellular MAPK feedback structure
shaping ERK dynamics. In our model, we used the well-established
ERK-RAF NFB. However, several NFBs have been mapped in the
MAPK signaling cascade, whose role in shaping ERK dynamics is
still unknown and which could also be responsible for the observed
oscillatory ERK dynamics.
RNA interference screen reveals that ERK dynamics remain
unaffected in response to perturbation of most MAPK
signaling nodes
We then explored the network circuitry that shapes optoFGFR-
evoked ERK dynamics with an RNA interference (RNAi) screen
targeting 50 MAPK signaling nodes. We focused our screen on
sustained optoFGFR input which captured the largest amount of
information about ERK dynamics when compared to other stimula-
tion schemes: it led to sustained and oscillatory ERK dynamics
(Fig2E and F) while recapitulating the rapid increase of ERK activity
and adaptation observed with transient input (FigEV1A and B). We
used a bioinformatic approach to select 50 known interactors of the
tripartite RAF/MEK/ERK cascade downstream of the FGFR receptor
that were detected in a NIH3T3 proteome (Schwanh€ausser et al,
2011) (Fig4A, Appendix TableS4). We used the siPOOL technology
to specifically knockdown (KD) these 50 MAPK signaling nodes
while limiting off-target effects (Hannuset al, 2014). We first vali-
dated KD efficiency by quantifying transcript levels with different
siPOOL concentrations targeting the ERK and MEK isoforms (Fig
EV2A) and observed strong KD with 10 nM siRNA concentration.
We then evaluated the effect ofERK1 or ERK2 KD on ERK dynamics.
We observed only subtle phenotypes compared to the non-targeting
siRNA (CTRL) used as negative control (Fig4B), even though effi-
cient KD was observed at protein level (Fig 4C). However, com-
bined ERK1/ERK2 KD strongly suppressed ERK dynamics indicating
that the latter is not affected by the perturbation of individual ERK
isoforms as previously reported (Fritsche-Guentheret al, 2011;
Ornitz & Itoh, 2015). Due to its strong phenotype, we usedERK1/
ERK2 KD as positive control throughout our screen.

We performed three replicates of the screen targeting the 50
nodes. Despite efficient KD quantified for different nodes (FigEV2B),
visual inspection of ERK trajectories only revealed subtle ERK
dynamics phenotypes for a limited number of node perturbations
(Fig EV2C and D). We used a feature-based approach to evaluate
the effect of each perturbation on ERK dynamics. We focused our
analysis on ERK responses evoked by high optoFGFR input to limit
the single-cell heterogeneity due to optoFGFR expression variability.

We quantified the average ERK activity before stimulation (base-
line), the maximal ERK amplitude during stimulation (maxPeak),
and the ERK amplitude at a fixed time point after response adapta-
tion in the negative control (ERKpostStim). To evaluate these phe-
notypes, we z-scored the features associated to each perturbation to
those of the negative control (Fig4D, see Materials and Methods for
details). While many phenotypes were statistically significant, most
of them remained mild as observed by visually inspection of the fea-
ture distributions (FigEV3A). Apart from ERK1+2 KD, only GRB2,
PTK2, andERK2 led to a reduction of ERK amplitude (maxPeak). KD
of negative regulators such asSPROUTY 2,3, and4, or phosphatases
such asPP2A and several dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) led
to increased ERK amplitude. Increased basal ERK activity was
observed forRKIP, PP2A, DUSP4, andDUSP6 KDs, indicating a func-
tion in regulating basal ERK levels. Prolonged ERK activity
(ERKpostStim) was observed in response to KD ofRKIP, PP2A,
ERK2, DUSP1,2,3,4,6 and strikingly for RSK2 KD (Fig EV3B),
suggesting a role of these nodes in ERK adaptation.
Because both visual inspection of trajectories, as well as our
feature-based approach might miss more subtle ERK dynamics
phenotypes, we used CODEX (Jacqueset al, 2021), a data-driven
approach to identify patterns in single-cell time series based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (FigEV3C). We trained a
CNN to classify ERK trajectories that originate from different
siRNA perturbations and selected the ten perturbations for which
the CNN classification accuracy was the highest (Appendix Table
S4, “CODEX accuracy”, see Materials and Methods for details).
Projection of the CNN features in a t-distributed stochastic neigh-
bor embedding (t-SNE) space revealed different clusters of ERK
trajectories (FigEV3D). Comparison of the ten trajectories with the
highest classification confidence identified by CODEX to randomly
selected ERK trajectories for low or high optoFGFR expression
highlighted ERK phenotypes not accessible to visual inspection
and the feature-based approach (Fig4E). CODEX identified some
of the perturbations that affect ERK amplitude, baseline or adapta-
tion observed with the feature-based approach. However, it also
highlighted perturbations affecting oscillatory ERK dynamics.PP2A
KD led to sustained oscillatory behavior.PLCG1 KD resulted in a
first peak followed by damped oscillations, and absence of the dip.
As phospholipase C mediates Ca2+ signaling in response to FGFR
activation (Ornitz & Itoh, 2015), this further validates the role of
Ca2+ signaling in formation of the dip (Appendix Fig S1D–F).
RAPGEF1 KD led to oscillatory ERK responses of different ampli-
tudes. RSK2, ERK2, and CRAF KD displayed reduced oscillatory
ERK behavior.
To validate the latter oscillatory ERK dynamics phenotypes, we
evaluated the proportion of oscillatory trajectories (trajectories with
at least 3 peaks) for each perturbation, both for high and low
optoFGFR input (Fig4F). This confirmed that RSK2, CRAF, and
ERK2 KD led to decreased oscillatory ERK dynamics. We also
observed that these perturbations reduced ERK oscillations in cells
stimulated with 1 ng/ml EGF (FigEV3E–G), suggesting a role of
these nodes in the regulation of ERK oscillations in the context of a
native RTK.
ERK2 and CRAF isoforms are implicated in the well-established
ERK-RAF NFB, known to regulate ERK dynamics (Santos et al,
2007; Ryu et al, 2015; Blum et al, 2019), and to enable consistent
ERK dynamics under MEK or ERK perturbations (Sturmet al, 2010;
Fritsche-Guenther et al, 2011). RSK2 encodes the p90 ribosomal S6
kinase 2 protein, an ERK substrate regulating survival and prolifera-
tion (Cargnello & Roux,2011; Yooet al, 2015). RSK2 is also known
to be involved in an ERK-induced NFB targeting SOS (Douville &
Downward,1997; Sahaet al, 2012; Lakeet al, 2016), whose signifi-
cance in the regulation of ERK dynamics has been less well studied.
In addition to dampening ERK oscillations,RSK2 KD also led to
slower ERK adaptation when optoFGFR input ceased (Figs4D and
EV3A and B), suggesting an important role of this NFB in ERK
dynamics regulation. Our results suggest that the ERK-RAF and
ERK-RSK2-SOS NFBs simultaneously operate within the MAPK net-
work to generate ERK oscillations and raise the question whether
both NFBs contribute to the strong MAPK signaling robustness
observed in our screen.
Direct optogenetic activation of RAS highlights different ERK
dynamics phenotypes than optoFGFR input
To further explore the role of MAPK feedback in MAPK signaling
robustness, we used optoSOS (Johnsonet al, 2017), an optogenetic
actuator that activates RAS, and thus bypasses the RSK2-mediated
NFB regulation (Fig5A). OptoSOS consists of a membrane anchored
light-activatable iLID domain, and an mCitrine-tagged SspB domain
fused to SOS’s catalytic GEF domain. It was stably integrated into

proportion of oscillating cells with low optoFGFR expression. Statistical analysis was done using a pairwiset-test, comparing each perturbation against theCTRL for
each receptor level independently (*< 0.05,* *< 0.005, ***< 0.0005, ****< 0.00005, FDRP-value correction method).

cells expressing ERK-KTR and H2B. Because iLID displays faster dis-
sociation rates than CRY2 (t1/2 = 30 s for iLID versus~5 min for
CRY2 (Duan et al, 2017; Benedetti et al, 2018)), optoSOS required
repeated light pulses to prolong its membrane recruitment and pro-
duce a robust ERK response (Fig5B). Five consecutive 100 ms light
pulses at 6 W/cm2 (D = 0.6 J/cm2) applied at 20-s intervals, pro-
vided the minimal light input to induce a saturated ERK amplitude
(FigEV4A). Application of this light input at 2-min intervals evoked
sustained ERK dynamics with small fluctuations at the same fre-
quency as the light input pattern, reflecting the fast optoSOS

reversion to the dark state (Fig5C). OptoSOS did not induce ERK
oscillations (Fig EV4B), even in cells with low optoSOS expression
or at lower light doses (Fig5D). However, ERK amplitudes corre-
lated with optoSOS expression level, low optoSOS levels led to low
ERK amplitudes, while high actuator expression levels resulted in
high ERK amplitudes. Using the minimal light input to trigger satu-
rating ERK amplitude, both optoSOS and optoFGFR led to steep ERK
activation and fast adaptation when light stimulation ceased (com-
pare Figs2C and 5C), as well as similar ERK amplitudes in cells
expressing high actuator levels (Fig 5E). However, high optoSOS
expression levels moderately increased ERK activity baseline levels
in comparison to optoFGFR (FigEV4C), suggesting that this system
is leaky to some extent.
Using this specific light input, we performed siRNA screens
targeting MAPK signaling nodes downstream of optoSOS in tripli-
cates (FigEV4D and E ). We extracted the baseline, maxPeak,
ERKpostStim features from optoSOS high expressing cells (Fig
EV4F) and z-scored feature values to the negative control (Fig5F).
We observed more prominent ERK amplitude phenotypes in
response to optoSOS input than to optoFGFR input. Some of these
phenotypes are shown in Fig5G. Most prominently, CRAF, ERK2,
and DUSP4 KD led to a stronger reduction in ERK amplitude than
observed with optoFGFR input.RSK2 KD also reduced ERK ampli-
tude, suggesting that it also regulates nodes downstream of RAS.
However,RSK2 KD did not decrease ERK adaptation following
optoSOS input removal (Fig EV4G), suggesting that it is not
involved in NFB regulation in this system.PP2A KD did not induce
increased ERK amplitude or baseline as observed in the optoFGFR
system. As for optoFGFR input,DUSP6 KD increased basal ERK
activity and decreased adaptation (Fig EV4G). DUSP22 KD led to
increased amplitude, without affecting ERK baseline and adapta-
tion.NF1 KD, which encodes a RAS-specific GAP, led to increased
ERK baseline and slower adaptation (FigEV4G), without affecting
ERK amplitude. The NF1 baseline phenotype, that was not
observed in the optoFGFR system, might emerge from the
optoSOS-mediated low levels of RAS activation due to the optoSOS
system’s leakiness (FigEV4C) that can then be amplified by loss
of NF1’s RAS GAP activity. The finding that perturbation of spe-
cific nodes (e.g., ERK2 and CRAF) leads to more penetrant pheno-
types in response to optoSOS versus optoFGFR input suggested
that the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK part of the network is more sensitive
to perturbations than optoFGFR-triggered network, suggesting that
the RSK2 NFB that operates above RAS contributes to MAPK sig-
naling robustness.
Perturbation of the RSK2-mediated NFB increases the efficiency
of RAF, MEK, and ERK targeting drugs
To further investigate the role of the RSK2-mediated NFB in MAPK
signaling robustness, we performed dose response experiments
using different MAPK inhibitors and compared ERK amplitudes
evoked by optoFGFR (RSK2-feedback dependent) versus optoSOS
(RSK2-feedback independent) input, as well as optoFGFR input in
absence/presence of RSK2 perturbation. We used drugs targeting B/
CRAF (RAF709), MEK (U0126) and ERK (SCH772984). We evalu-
ated the inhibition efficiency by measuring ERK amplitude at a fixed
time point, focusing on ERK responses evoked by high optoFGFR or
optoSOS inputs to limit the single-cell heterogeneity due to expres-
sion variability of the optogenetic actuator. All inhibitors led to a
stronger reduction of ERK amplitude and EC50 in response to
optoSOS versus optoFGFR input (Figs6A–C and EV5A, Appendix
Table S5). Visual evaluation of ERK amplitude distributions (Fig6B)
and quantification of their standard deviations (Fig 6D) revealed
more compact ERK amplitude distributions in presence of increas-
ing drug concentrations in response to optoSOS versus optoFGFR
input. This suggests a more homogeneous drug inhibition in the
cell population in response to optoSOS input. We then performed
the identical experiments inCTRL or RSK2 KD cells in response to
optoFGFR input (Figs 6E–H and EV5B, Appendix Table S6). RSK2
KD led to increased inhibition of ERK amplitudes, decreased EC50,
and more compact ERK amplitude distributions in response to
increasing drug concentration than inCTRL KD cells. Similar results
were observed when the RSK2-mediated feedback was inhibited
using the RSK inhibitor SL0101 (Smithet al, 2005)( F i gEV5C–F,
Appendix TableS7). Thus, inhibition of the RSK2-mediated NFB sen-
sitizes ERK responses to RAF, MEK or ERK drug perturbations. Note
that drug mediated ERK amplitude inhibition was stronger in
response to optoSOS input than to optoFGFR input withRSK2 KD or
RSK inhibition, suggesting that additional mechanisms to the RSK2-
mediated feedback contribute to MAPK signaling robustness. How-
ever, our results suggest that perturbation of the RSK2-mediated feed-
back can be exploited to enhance the efficiency of MAPK-targeting
drugs, reducing ERK amplitudes more homogeneously across the cell
population.

Targeting the RSK2-mediated feedback in an ErbB2 oncogenic
signaling model increases MEK inhibition efficiency
The results above suggested an important role of the RSK2-mediated
feedback in MAPK signaling robustness against node perturbation in
response to optogenetic inputs in NIH3T3 cells. To test whether this
feedback also contributes to MAPK signaling robustness in a
disease-relevant system, we evaluated its function in MCF10A cells,
a breast epithelium model, using either wild-type (WT) or overex-
pressing ErbB2 (referred to as ErbB2over) recapitulating the ErbB2
amplification observed in 20% of all breast cancers (Yarden & Pines,
2012; Arteaga & Engelman,2014). We chose this specific model sys-
tem because ErbB2 amplification leads to constitutive RTK input on
the MAPK network, while retaining an intact downstream feedback
structure (Fig7A). This contrasts with other cancer model systems
in which additional mutations might lead to RAS or RAF overactiva-
tion, and thus disrupt the feedback architecture. Further, previous
work has highlighted the role of NFBs in ERK pulse formation in
MCF10A cells (Kochańczyk et al, 2017), suggesting that EGFR and
ErbB2 trigger a MAPK network with similar feedback circuitry as
optoFGFR.
As described before (Albeck et al, 2013), WT cells displayed
asynchronous low-frequency ERK pulses in the absence of EGF, and
high-frequency ERK pulses in presence of EGF (Fig7B). In marked
contrast, ErbB2over cells displayed high frequency ERK pulses, even
in the absence of EGF (Fig7C). To investigate the role of the RSK2-
mediated feedback in MAPK signaling robustness, we performed a
U0126 dose response in EGF-stimulated MCF10A WT cells and
found that 3µM U0126 decreased ERK amplitude without fully
suppressing the response (Fig EV5G and H ). As observed in
response to optogenetic inputs, RSK inhibition with 50µM SL0101
led to a mild reduction in ERK amplitude. However, in combination
with 3µM U0126, ERK amplitude was decreased to the level of
unstimulated cells. Similar results were observed in ErbB2over cells
(Fig EV5I), suggesting that RSK2 perturbation increases the sensitiv-
ity of ERK responses to MEK inhibition.
As averaging ERK dynamics can hide asynchronous single-cell
signaling activity, we further investigated the effect of these pertur-
bations on single-cell trajectories using CODEX (Jacqueset al, 2021)
(see Materials and Methods for details). For WT cells, a tSNE projec-
tion of the CNN features built from single-cell ERK trajectories
hinted that the CNN was able to construct features separating the
treatments into well-defined clusters (Figs7D and EV5J). Clustering
of the CNN features confirmed the existence of discrete ERK dynam-
ics clusters (Fig7E) whose composition correlated with the treat-
ments (Fig 7F). To characterize the dynamics captured by each
cluster, we extracted the medoid trajectory and its 4 closest neigh-
bors from each cluster (Fig7G). This revealed that non-stimulated
cells mostly display low frequency ERK activity pulses (cluster 4) or
absence of pulses (cluster 5). Cells stimulated with EGF without
inhibitor displayed ERK pulses of high amplitude (cluster 1).
SL0101-treated cells displayed a sustained ERK activation at low
amplitude (cluster 3). U0126-treated cells still displayed prominent
ERK pulses but at a lower amplitude than EGF-treated cells in
absence of drug (cluster 2). Finally, in cells treated with both U0126
and SL0101, almost no ERK activity was observed (cluster 5). For
ErbB2over cells, we observed that the CNN features were forming a
more continuous space with less distinct clusters (Figs7H and I,
and EV5K). A heterogeneous mix of ERK trajectory clusters was
observed for the different treatments (Fig7J and K). Untreated cells
mostly displayed high frequency ERK pulses that were either sharp
(cluster 3) or wider (cluster 2). SL0101-treated cells were almost
equally shared between cluster 1 (relatively flat high-amplitude ERK
trajectories), cluster 2, cluster 4 (low-amplitude ERK pulses) and
cluster 5 (low baseline activity). U0126 led to a less heterogeneous
mix mostly consisting of ERK trajectories from cluster 4 and 5. The
U0126/SL0101 combination shifted most cells to cluster 5, indicat-
ing an efficient inhibition of ERK activity at a suboptimal U0126 con-
centration. Thus, RSK inhibition also sensitizes the MAPK network
to U0126-mediated MEK inhibition both in MCF10A WT and ErbB2-
over cells.
Discussion
Optogenetic actuator-biosensor circuits allow for feedback
structure mapping in the MAPK network
ERK dynamics is crucial for fate decisions. Yet, the topology of the
network enabling the cells to sense different inputs and convert this
information into finely tuned ERK dynamics remains poorly under-
stood. We developed genetic circuits consisting of optogenetic actu-
ators and an ERK biosensor (Figs1A and 5A) that allow for a large-
scale interrogation of single-cell ERK dynamics and investigated the

effects of 50 RNAi perturbations targeting components of the MAPK
signaling network (Fig 4A). In our optoFGFR screen, we only
observed a small number of penetrant ERK dynamics phenotypes
(Fig4D–F), implying that the MAPK network can buffer against per-
turbations of most of its components. We cannot exclude that in
some cases, even on the relatively short 72 h timescale of the RNAi
experiment, compensation by upregulation of specific nodes might
occur. However, our data suggest that the MAPK network topology
allows for MAPK signaling robustness— the production of consistent
ERK outputs in presence of node perturbation. This might emerge
from isoform redundancy for multiple nodes in the network, as
observed for single or combined ERK isoforms perturbation (Fig4B),
but also for individual perturbation of RAS, RAF, MEK isoforms.
Another mechanism might involve NFBs that have been shown to

decrease the network sensitivity to node perturbation (Sturmet al,
2010; Fritsche-Guenther et al, 2011). Our screen suggested that
RSK2, that mediates a NFB from ERK to SOS (Douville & Down-
ward,1997; Saha et al, 2012), both regulates ERK dynamics
(Fig 4D–F) and plays a role in MAPK signaling robustness (Fig6E–H).
In addition, our data suggest that the well-studied ERK-RAF NFB,
which has been shown to buffer against MAPK node perturbations
(Sturmet al, 2010; Fritsche-Guenther et al, 2011), also regulates
ERK dynamics (Fig4F). We therefore speculate that feedback oper-
ates simultaneously in the MAPK network, and act at multiple
levels within the cascade to warrant MAPK signaling robustness.
Consistently with this hypothesis, we observed that the optoSOS-
triggered network, which is not under the RSK2 NFB regulation,
shows an increased sensitivity in ERK amplitude to perturbation of
some nodes (Fig5F and G). Indeed, ERK2 and CRAF perturbations,
which led to loss of ERK oscillations, had relatively mild amplitude
phenotypes in response to optoFGFR input, while both perturba-
tions led to strong ERK amplitude phenotypes in response to
optoSOS input. Because these phenotypes were not observed with
other ERK and RAF isoforms, we propose that ERK2 and CRAF are
the isoforms involved in the classic ERK-RAF NFB. Additional feed-
back has been reported within the MAPK network (Langloiset al,
1995;L a k eet al, 2016;K o c h ańczyk et al, 2017), and even if they
have not been highlighted in our screen, they might also regulate
ERK dynamics.
While providing the experimental throughput to perturb and ana-
lyze ERK dynamics at scale, optoFGFR, that lacks an ectodomain,
evoked different ERK dynamics than endogenous RTKs such as FGFR
and EGFR (Fig3A and Bcompared to Fig2F). These different ERK
dynamics emerge likely because of receptor-level interactions that
involve competition of bFGF for FGFR and heparan sulfate proteogly-
can co-receptors (Kanodiaet al, 2014; Blum et al, 2019) in the case
of FGFR, or receptor endocytosis in the case of EGFR (Gerosaet al,
2020; Kiyatkinet al, 2020). Our combined modeling and experimen-
tal approach suggested that optoFGFR and EGFR share similar down-
stream MAPK network circuitries and NFBs (Fig3C–G). OptoFGFR
therefore provides a simplified system that allowed us to focus on
intracellular feedback structures, without confounding receptor-level
regulations. Our Bayesian inference modeling approach, that is
parameter agnostic, could provide simple intuitions about the
receptor-level and negative feedback structures that shape ERK
dynamics in response to optoFGFR and EGFR inputs. However, even
if we had access to many ERK dynamics phenotypes, our modeling
approach did not allow us to explore more sophisticated MAPK net-
work topologies such as the presence of two NFBs or multiple node
isoforms. We interpreted our data using some of the feedback struc-
tures that have been previously experimentally documented and
modeled but cannot formally exclude that the observed ERK dynam-
ics emerge from different network structures. In the future, informa-
tion about the different nodes and their dynamics might allow to
further constrain the model topology and parameter space, and
hopefully address this limitation.
Additional novel insights into regulation of ERK dynamics
Our optoFGFR and optoSOS screens provided new system-wide
insights into the regulation of the MAPK network. Strikingly, the
same perturbations induced different ERK dynamics phenotypes in
the optoFGFR and optoSOS screens. This might occur because some
regulators target the MAPK network at multiple levels, differently
affecting ERK responses triggered with optoFGFR or optoSOS inputs.
Additionally, as the two optogenetic systems are under the regula-
tion of one versus two simultaneously occurring NFBs, they might
have different sensitivities to perturbations, as discussed above.
With respect to the optoFGFR system,GRB2 KD led to a reduc-
tion of ERK amplitude (Fig 4D and E). GRB2 acts as the RTK-
proximal adaptor to activate SOS (Chardin et al, 1993; Belov &
Mohammadi, 2012). As GRB2 operates at the start of the cascade,
outside of most NFBs, heterogeneity in its expression levels might
be less easily buffered out.PLCG1 KD increased damped oscillatory
behavior (Fig 4E and F). Phospholipase Cɣ1 activates calcium sig-
naling, which has itself been shown to regulate RAS/MAPK signal-
ing in a calcium spike frequency-dependent manner (Cullen &
Lockyer,2002; Kupzig et al, 2005). Further investigation will be
required to understand the significance of this crosstalk.RKIP KD
resulted in higher ERK baseline and slower ERK adaptation post-
stimulation, without affecting ERK amplitude (Fig4D). RKIP (RAF
kinase inhibitor protein) prevents MEK phosphorylation by CRAF
(Yeunget al, 2000), suggesting that RKIP-dependent regulation is
specifically involved in keeping basal ERK activity low. With respect
to phosphatases, none of their perturbations led to a strong pheno-
type such as sustained ERK dynamics post-stimulation for example.
The strongest phenotype was observed forPP2A KD that led to
increased ERK amplitude, baseline, and slower adaptation (Figs4D
and EV3A). This might occur because the protein phosphatase 2A is
an ubiquitous phosphatase that acts at multiple levels by depho-
sphorylating SHC1, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1 and ERK2, as well as a large
number of other proteins (Junttilaet al, 2008; Saraf et al, 2010).
The observation that in optoFGFR-lowPP2A KD cells, ERK dynam-
ics displayed increased amplitude but still oscillated rather than
exhibiting sustained behavior, suggests that NFBs might buffer
against the loss of phosphatase regulation to some extent. Perturba-
tion of the nuclear DUSPs, DUSP1,2,4, the atypical DUSP3 and most
strongly the cytosolic DUSP6 (Pattersonet al, 2009) led to higher
ERK baseline, reduced adaptation, with only limited effects on
amplitude (Figs4D and EV3A). Consistently, DUSP6 has previously
been proposed to pre-emptively dephosphorylate MAPKs to main-
tain low ERK activity baseline levels at resting state (Huang & Tan,
2012). Our results indicate that perturbation of single DUSPs might
not be compensated by the others, suggesting that individual DUSPs
might regulate specific substrates within the MAPK network. Except
forDUSP6, KD of the different DUSPs did not significantly affect
oscillatory ERK behavior in optoFGFR-low cells (Fig4F), suggesting
that they are not involved in the MAPK feedback circuitry that oper-
ates on timescales of minutes.
The optoSOS screen revealed stronger ERK amplitude pheno-
types, especially for ERK2 and CRAF KD (Fig 5F versus Fig 4D).
Unlike for optoFGFR input,RSK2 KD did not result in slower ERK
adaptation, suggesting that ERK responses triggered by the optoSOS
input are not regulated by the RSK2-mediated NFB. However,RSK2
KD led to a reduction of ERK amplitude, also observed to a lesser
extent in response to optoFGFR input, suggesting a role of RSK2 in
ERK amplitude regulation downstream of RAS. With respect to
phosphatases,PP2A KD led to decreased amplitude, a different phe-
notype than in response to optoFGFR input. This might occur
because of the broad specificity PP2A phosphatase, which might

lead to different phospho-proteomes in response to optoSOS versus
optoFGFR input. Similar phenomena might apply for most of the
DUSPs.
The RSK2-mediated feedback can be targeted to potently inhibit
oncogenic ErbB2 signaling
Our data suggest that the RSK2-mediated NFB is important for
MAPK signaling robustness downstream of our prototypic optoFGFR
RTK (Fig6). We found that the RSK2-mediated NFB likely also oper-
ates downstream of EGFR and oncogenic ErbB2 signaling in
MCF10A cells (Fig7). In response to EGF stimulation, or ErbB2
overexpression, a subset of RSK-inhibited cells displayed wider ERK
pulses, suggesting that the RSK2 NFB is also involved in ERK adap-
tation in this system (Fig7G cluster 3, Fig7K cluster 1 and 2). Fur-
ther, RSK inhibition led to a high heterogeneity of ERK dynamics
within the cell population especially visible in the case of ErbB2
overexpressing cells (Fig7J), which might result from the reduced
ability of the MAPK network to cope with nodes expression noise in
absence of the RSK2 NFB. In EGF-treated cells, combination of RSK
and suboptimal MEK inhibition led to strong and homogeneous ERK
inhibition (Fig7E–G, cluster 5). In the ErbB2 overexpressing cells,
combined RSK/MEK inhibition shifted most of the cell population to
flat, low amplitude ERK dynamics, enabling to further inhibit a large
number of cells when compared to suboptimal MEK inhibition only
(Fig7I–K, cluster 5). These results suggest that pharmacological
inhibition of the RSK2-mediated NFB can be used to reduce MAPK
signaling robustness, sensitizing the network to MEK perturbation.
Such non-trivial drug combinations might allow for homogeneous
inhibition of ERK dynamics in most of the cells in a population. This
homogeneous inhibition might mitigate the emergence of drug-
tolerant persister cells from cell subpopulations that display residual
ERK activity in response to inhibition of a single node. Our results
imply that efficient pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK net-
work requires precise understanding of its topology. The RSK2 NFB
is an example of a druggable node that can be exploited to target
MAPK signaling robustness.
Our scalable experimental pipeline provides new insight into the
MAPK network wiring that produces ERK dynamics. However, our
perturbation approach only highlighted very subtle ERK dynamics
phenotypes, precluding a complete understanding of the MAPK net-
work. We envision that this will require more precise knowledge
about the dynamics of MAPK network nodes and their interactions
in response to defined inputs and perturbations. Such data can now
be produced at scale using optogenetic actuator/biosensor circuits
as those we describe in this work. This information might allow for
faithful parametrization of more complex models. With the increas-
ing amount of optogenetic actuators and biosensors available, simi-
lar genetic circuits could also be designed to study the dynamics of
other signaling pathways at scale.

Plasmids and stable cell line generation
The optoFGFR construct was a gift from Won Do Heo (Addgene
plasmid # 59776) (Kimet al, 2014). It consists of the myristoylated
FGFR1 cytoplasmic region fused with the PHR domain of the cryp-
tochrome2 and tagged with mCitrine. It was cloned in a lentiviral
backbone for stable cell line generation. A modified version of the
optoFGFR tagged with the red fluorophore mScarlet (Bindelset al,
2017) was cloned in a PiggyBac plasmid pPBbSr2-MCS (blasticidin
resistance), a gift from Kazuhiro Aoki. The optoSOS construct is a
modified version of the tRFP-SSPB-SOScat-P2A-iLID-CAAX
(Addgene plasmid #86439) (Johnsonet al, 2017), in which we
replaced the tRFP by mCitrine. The construct was cloned in the
pPB3.0. Puro, an improved PiggyBac plasmid generated in our lab
with puromycin resistance. The ERK-KTR-mRuby2 and ERK-KTR-
mTurquoise2 reporters were generated by fusing the ERK Kinase
Translocation Reporter (ERK-KTR) (Regotet al, 2014) with
mRuby2 (Lam et al, 2012) or mTurquoise2 (Goedhartet al, 2012).
The nuclear marker H2B-miRFP703 is a fusion of the human H2B
clustered histone 11 (H2BC11) with the monomeric near-infrared
fluorescent protein miRFP703 (Shcherbakovaet al, 2016) (Addgene
plasmid #80001). ERK-KTR-mRuby2, ERK-KTR-mTurquoise2, and
H2B-miRFP703 were cloned in the PiggyBac plasmids pPB3.0.
Hygro, pSB-HPB (gift of David Hacker, EPFL, (Balasubramanianet
al, 2016)), and pPB3.0. Blast, respectively. All constructs in
PiggyBac plasmids were co-transfected with the helper plasmid
expressing the transposase (Yusaet al, 2011) for stable insertion
using the jetPEI (Polyplus) transfection reagent for NIH3T3 cells or
FuGene (Promega) transfection reagent for MCF10A cells. After
antibiotic selection, NIH3T3 cells were FACS-sorted to generate
stable cell lines homogeneously expressing the biosensors. In the
case of MCF10A cells, clones with uniform biosensor expression
were isolated. To generate ErbB2 overexpressing MCF10A cells,
lentiviral transduction using a pHAGE-ERBB2 construct (a gift from

puromycin.
Live imaging of ERK dynamics
NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 96-well 1.5 glass-bottom plates
(Cellvis) coated with 10 μg/ml Fibronectin (Huber lab) using
1.5 × 103 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. MCF10A cells were
seeded in 24-well 1.5 glass-bottom plates (Cellvis) coated with 5μg/
ml Fibronectin (Huber lab) at 1× 105 cells/well and incubated for
48 h. NIH3T3 cells were washed with PBS and incubated in starving
medium for 4 h in the dark before starting the experiment. MCF10A
cells were starved for 7 h before starting the experiments. In experi-
ments involving drug perturbations, cells were incubated for 2 h (or
1 h in MCF10A experiments) with the inhibitor(s). Imaging was
performed with an epifluorescence Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence
microscope (Nikon) using a Plan Apo air 20× (NA 0.8) objective.
Nikon Perfect Focus System (PFS) was used to keep cells in focus
throughout the experiment. Illumination was done with a SPECTRA
X light engine (Lumencor) with the following filters (Chroma):
mTurquoise2: 440 nm LED, 470lp, 69308 CFP/YFP/mCherry-ET,
CFP 458–482; mCitrine: 508 nm LED, ET500/20×, 69308bs, ET535/
30m; mRuby2 and mCherry: 555 nm LED, ET575/25×, 69008bs,
59022m, miRFP703: 640 nm LED, ET640/30×, 89100bs Sedat Quad,
84101m Quad. Images were acquired with an Andor Zyla 4.2 plus
camera at a 16-bit depth. Image acquisition and optogenetic stimula-
tion were controlled with the NIS-Element JOBS module. For
NIH3T3 experiments, ERK-KTR-mRuby2 and H2B-miRFP703 were
acquired at 1-min interval and 470-nm light inputs were delivered at
specific frequencies and intensities (see below). MCF10A image
acquisition was performed at 5-min time resolution. Growth factor
stimulations were done by manually pipetting EGF and bFGF during
the experiment. We used mCitrine intensity to quantify the expres-
sion level of the optogenetic constructs. However, as mCitrine exci-
tation leads to optoFGFR or optoSOS activation, we acquired one
frame with the ERK-KTR-mRuby2, the H2B-miRFP703, and the
mCitrine-tagged optoFGFR or optoSOS only at the end of each
NIH3T3 experiments. All experiments were carried on at 37°C with
5% CO2.
Optogenetic stimulation
Light stimulations were delivered with a 470 nm LED light source
that was hardware-triggered by the camera to generate light pulses
of reproducible duration. Light stimulations of defined intensity and
duration were programmed to be automatically delivered at specific
timepoints. To define the dose of light received by the cells, we mea-
sured the 470 nm light intensity at the focal plane using an optical
power meter (X-Cite Power Meter, Lumen Dynamics Group) and
converted this value to a power density as

with FN = 18 mm. The obtained value was then multiplied by the
duration of the pulse to obtain the dose of light received by the
cells for each light pulse.

For stimulation of the optoFGFR cells, the 470-nm LED intensity
was limited to a low dose by combining a ZET470/10× filter and a
ND filter 5% (Chroma). Transient stimulations were done with a
single pulse, while sustained stimulations were done with single
pulses delivered every 2 min. For stimulation of the optoSOS cells,
we used the 470 nm LED with a ET470/24× filter (no ND filter).
Transient stimulations were done with 5 pulses repeated at 20-s
intervals, while sustained stimulations were done using 5 pulses
repeated at 20-s intervals, delivered every 2 min.

images were acquired with a 561 nm laser using a ET575/25 filter in
front of the ZT488/561rpc (Chroma) to prevent nonspecific activa-
tion of the CRY2. MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging) was
used for acquisition. TIRF images of the optoFGFR-mScarlet were
acquired at a 20-s interval. Optogenetic stimulation was done using
a 470 nm LED (SPECTRA X, Lumencor) (Appendix FigS1B). All
experiments were carried on at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Image processing pipeline
Nuclear segmentation was done in CellProfiler 3.0 (McQuinet al,
2018) using a threshold-based approach of the H2B channel. In the
case of MCF10A cells, nuclear segmentation was preceded by pre-
diction of nuclear probability using a random forest classifier based
on different pixel features available in Ilastik software (Berget al,
2019). To measure the ERK-KTR fluorescence in the cytosol, the
nuclear mask was first expanded by 2 pixels to exclude the blurred
edges of the nucleus. The new mask was then further expanded by
4 pixels in a threshold-based manner to obtain a “ring” area corre-
sponding to the cytoplasmic ERK-KTR. ERK activity was obtained
by calculating the ratio between the average cytosolic pixel intensity
and the average nuclear pixel intensity. Single-cell tracking was
done on nuclear centroids with MATLAB usingμ-track 2.2.1
(Jaqaman et al, 2008). The final images containing the ERK-KTR-
mRuby2, H2B-miRFP703, and the optoFGFR-mCitrine (or optoSOS-
mCitrine) channels were processed using the same CellProfiler set-
tings as the time-lapse images. Intensity of the mCitrine was
extracted under the ERK-KTR cytoplasmic mask and used to classify
cells into low or high expressors in a threshold-based manner. For
optoFGFR-evoked ERK responses, the threshold was defined empiri-
cally to separate oscillatory and non-oscillatory ERK responses (low
<−1.75 (log10 mCitrine intensity) < high). For optoSOS-evoked
ERK responses, the threshold was defined empirically to separate
cells with low or high ERK response amplitudes (low< −1.25
(log10 mCitrine intensity)< high). The same thresholds were kept
across experiments to compare low and high expressors.
The optoFGFR-mScarlet dimers/oligomers were segmented using
the pixel classification module from Ilastik (Berg et al, 2019).
OptoFGFR dimers, cell background and trafficking vesicles were
manually annotated on images before and after the light stimula-
tion. A probability map of the optoFGFR dimers classification was
exported as TIFF for each frame. We then computed the mean of
pixel intensities from the binarized mask obtained with Ilastik using
Fiji (Appendix FigS1C).
Quantification of ERK activity
We wrote a set of custom R scripts to automatically calculate the
ERK-KTR cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio as a proxy for ERK activity for
each single-cell, link single-cell ERK responses with the corre-
sponding optoFGFR/optoSOS intensity value and export the corre-
sponding ERK single-cell trajectories. For NIH3T3 data, outliers in
ERK single-cell trajectories were removed using a clustering-based
approach (https://github.com/pertzlab/Outlier_app). Trajectories
with an ERK activity higher than 0.8 or lower than 0.2 before stimu-
lation, above 1.6 during the whole experiment or displaying single
time point spiking values were removed. For MCF10A data, trajecto-
ries with an ERK activity above 2 or shorter than 90% of the total
experiment duration were removed. All the R codes used for further
analysis are available as supplementary information (see Data avail-
ability section). Hierarchical clustering analysis of single-cell trajec-
tories (Figs2D, EV3F and G, and EV4B) was done using Time
Course Inspector (Dobrzyn´ski et al, 2019).
Modeling
The model for the EGF and light stimulated ERK cascade is a kinetic
model, representing the EGF receptor, the inter-cellular proteins
(RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK) as well as a negative feedback (NFB) from
ERK to RAF and the inactivation of the EGF receptor in the form of
endocytosis (Fig3D). We explicitly modeled the ERK-KTR readout
through nuclear and cytosolic KTR. The initial fraction of cytosolic
KTR is estimated from the data through the parameterktrinit. The
KTR readout Y(t) was taken to be the ratio of cytosolic KTR over
nuclear KTR with additive Gaussian noise.
YðtÞ¼ KTR
KTR∗ þ ∈:
∈∼ Normalð0; σ2Þ:
where the variance of the measurement noise σ2 was estimated
from the data.
Appendix TableS1 shows all modeled species, their notation
used for the equation, as well as the initial values. We assume that
in the beginning of the experiment, all species are in the inactive
form, reflecting the fact that the cells have been starved. The total
concentrations of all species have been normalized to 1. The model
equations are shown in Appendix TableS2. The phosphorylation
events are modeled with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The NFB is
modeled through the modeling speciesNFB and its “active” version
NFB*, which affects the dephosphorylation rate ofRAF linearly. The
activation, endocytosis, and recycling of the EGF receptor is
modeled linearly. The model parameters are described in Appendix
TableS3. For the modeling of the two smaller models (without feed-
back (Fig EV1E) or without endocytosis (Fig EV1H)), we set the
corresponding parameters (knfb and r2,3) to zero.
For the parameter inference, we used a Nested Sampling algo-
rithm as described in (Mikelson & Khammash,2020). The inference
was performed on the ETH High-performance Cluster Euler and was
done using the parallel implementation on 48 cores. The algorithm
was run for 24 h or until the algorithm stopped because the termina-
tion criterionΔLFNS (see (Mikelson & Khammash,2020) for details)
was /C0 ∞. As prior distributions, we chose for all parameters non-
informative log-uniform priors between 10−5 and 105, except for
ktrinit for which we chose a uniform prior on the interval [0, 1] and
for σ for which we chose a log-uniform prior between 10−5 and 1.
Predictive distributions can be found on Figs3F and G, and EV1F,
G, I and J.
RNAi perturbation screen
We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) to select pro-
teins directly interacting with ERK, MEK, RAF, RAS and FGFR, that
are known to be expressed in NIH3T3 cells using a proteomics
approach (Jensenet al, 2009; Schwanh€ausser et al, 2011) (Appendix

Table S4). We then imported this protein list in STRING (Jensen
et al, 2009) to generate an interaction network with a minimum
interaction score of 0.4. The final interactome was manually modi-
fied to display the protein names to facilitate the readout (Fig4A).
We targeted these selected proteins with RNA interference, using
the siPOOL technology (one siPOOL containing a mix of 30 siRNAs
targeting the same gene (Hannuset al, 2014), sequences available
in the Data availability section). We arranged the siPOOLs in a 96
well plate format (in columns 2–5 and 8–11, one well per siPOOL)
with the non-targeting siRNA (CTRL) and the positive control (mix
of 5 nM siPOOL against ERK1 and 5 nM siPOOL against ERK2)
placed alternately in columns 1, 6, 7, and 12. Cells were reverse
transfected using RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher, 13778150) following
the recommended siPOOL transfection protocol (https://
sitoolsbiotech.com/protocols.php). OptoFGFR-expressing cells were
transfected with 10 nM of siPOOL in a 96-well 1.5 glass-bottom
plate (Cellvis) coated with 10μg/ml Fibronectin (Huber Lab) at
0.3 × 103 cells/well density and incubated for 72 h at 37°C and 5%
CO2. For the imaging, the 96-well plate was divided into 15 sub-
experiments, each sub-experiment consisting of a negative control
well, a positive control well and 4 wells with different siPOOLs. We
selected 2 FOVs per well and programmed the microscope to run
the 15 experiments sequentially, acquiring the ERK-KTR-mRuby2
and the H2B-miRFP703 channels with a 1-min interval, stimulating
the cells with sustained optoFGFR input (2-min intervals,
D= 18 mJ/cm2), and acquiring a final frame with ERK-KTR-
mRuby2, H2B-miRFP703, and optoFGFR-mCitrine (Figs4B and D–F,
EV2C and D, EV3A–D, 6F–H and EV5B). For the optoSOS system,
we limited the perturbation screen to targets acting below RAS (Figs
5Fand G, and EV4D–G). Stimulations were done with sustained
optoSOS input (5 repeated pulses at 2-min intervals, D = 0.6 J/
cm2). For EGF experiments, cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml EGF
at t = 5 min (FigEV3E–G).
Real-time qPCR
Cells were transfected with different concentrations of siPOOL in
a 24-well plate at 5 × 103 cells/well density and incubated at
37°C with 5% CO2 for 72 h before RNA isolation. Reverse tran-
scription was done with the ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase
kit (Bioconcept, M0368L). Real-time qPCRs were run using the
MESA Green pPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Green assay (Euro-
genetec, RT-SY2X-03+WOU) on the Rotor-Gen Q device (Qiagen).
Each sample was tested in triplicate. Expression level of the
gene of interest was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method with
GAPDH expression level as internal control (Fig EV2A). The fol-
lowing primers were used for the RT –qPCR (designed with the
Real-time PCR (TaqMan) Primer and Probes Design Tool from
GenScript).

Immunoblotting
Cells were transfected with 10 nM siPOOL in 6 well plates at
6 × 104 cells/well density and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for
72 h. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM
EDTA, and 1% SDS. Protein concentration was determined with the
BCATM protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher, 23227). Home cast 10%
SDS gels or Novex 4 –20% 10 well Mini Gels (Thermo Fisher,
XP04200) were used for SDS–PAGE. Transfer was done using PVDF
membranes and a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer
Cell (Bio-Rad). Imaging was done with an Odyssey Fluorescence
scanner (Li-COR) (Figs4C and EV2B). The following primary anti-
bodies were used: anti-total ERK (M7927, Sigma), anti-MEK1
(ab32091, Abcam), anti-MEK2 (ab32517, Abcam), anti-BRAF (sc-
5284, Santa Cruz), anti-CRAF (9422S, Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-SOS1 (610096, Biosciences), anti-GRB2 (PA5-17692, Invi-
trogen), and anti-RSK2 (sc-9986, Santa Cruz). Anti-GAPDH (sc-
32233, Santa Cruz) or anti-Actin (A2066, Merck) was used as pro-
tein of reference. For the secondary antibodies, we used the IRDye
680LT donkey anti-mouse IgG (926-68022, Li-COR), IRDye 800CW
goat anti-mouse (926-32210, Li-COR), and IRDye 800CW donkey
anti-rabbit (926-32213, Li-COR). Protein quantification was done
with the Image StudioTM Lite software.
Time series feature extraction
We used custom scripts to extract features of ERK responses to tran-
sient optoFGFR input (Figs2B and EV1A and B), sustained GF input
(Fig EV1C and D), and transient optoSOS input (Fig EV4A). The
maximum peak (maxPeak) is the absolute value of the highest ERK
activity in the trajectory. To estimate the full width at half maximum
(FWHM), we first removed the baseline of the trajectories and
increased their sampling frequency by a factor 30 with spline inter-
polation. On the resulting trajectory, we applied a “walk” procedure
to quantify the FWHM. In this method, a pointer walks left and right
(i.e., opposite and along the direction of time, respectively) from the
maximum point of the trajectory. The pointer stops whenever the
half maximum value is crossed. Both stops define a left and a right
border, the time difference between these 2-border timepoints gives
the FWHM. To avoid reporting aberrant FWHM values in cases
where a peak cannot be clearly defined, we excluded FWHM calcu-
lation for trajectories where the fold change between the baseline
(mean activity before stimulation) and the maximum value of the
trajectory was below a threshold manually defined. ERKpostStim is
the absolute value of ERK activity extracted 9 min after the last stim-
ulation pulse to evaluate ERK adaptation. Statistical analysis (Fig
EV1A and B) was done by comparing all conditions to the 20-min
interval stimulation patterns with a Wilcoxon test using the FDR
P-value correction (NS: non-significant, * < 0.01, ** < 0.001,
***< 0.0001, and ****< 0.00001).
To evaluate ERK phenotypes under siRNA perturbations in
response to sustained optoFGFR or optoSOS input (Figs4D, EV3A,
18 of 22 Molecular Systems Biology 18:e 10670 | 2022 ª 2022 The Authors

5F and EV4F), we extracted the baseline (average ERK activity on
5 timepoints before stimulation), the maxPeak (maximum ERK
activity within a 10-min time window following the start of the stim-
ulation) and the ERKpostStim (ERK activity at a fixed timepoint
post-stimulation (toptoFGFR = 42 min andtoptoSOS = 40 min)) from 3
technical replicates. To avoid heterogeneity due to differences in
optogenetic expression, we focused our analysis on cells with high
optogenetic expression. The obtained baseline, maxPeak and
ERKpostStim for each siRNA perturbation were z-scored to the non-
targeting siRNA (CTRL). Non-significant results were manually set
to gray. Statistical analysis was done by comparing each perturba-
tion to the control with a Wilcoxon test using the FDRP-value cor-
rection (NS: non-significant, * < 0.05, ** < 0.005, *** < 0.0005,
****< 0.00005).
For the comparison of both optogenetic systems (Figs 5E and
EV4C), ERK baseline was obtained by averaging ERK activity on 5
timepoints before stimulation and ERK maxPeak was extracted
within a 10-min time window following the start of the stimulation.
Statistical analysis was done by comparing low and high expressing
cells within and across optogenetic systems with a Wilcoxon test
using the FDRP-value correction (NS: non-significant, * < 0.05,
**< 0.005, ***< 0.0005, ****< 0.00005).
To quantify the efficiency of the three MAPK inhibitors on the
reduction of ERK amplitudes under sustained high optoFGFR or
optoSOS input (Fig6), extraction of the maxPeak was limited by the
fact that several concentrations led to a full suppression of ERK
amplitudes. Therefore, we extracted ERK amplitudes at a fixed time
point following the start of the stimulation (tfixed optoFGFR = 15 min,
tfixed optoSOS = 10 min). The obtained ERK amplitudes were then
plotted for each concentration for a fixed number of cells randomly
selected (Figs6B and F, and EV5D). To calculate the EC50 of each
drug, we normalized the data by setting the mean ERK responses of
the non-treated condition to 1 and the mean ERK responses of the
maximum concentration to 0. EC50 then was calculated by fitting a
Hill function to the mean ERK activity of each concentration (Figs
6Cand G, and EV5E, Appendix TablesS5–S7). The heterogeneity of
ERK amplitude at the fixed time point was evaluated by computing
the normalized standard deviation of the extracted ERK activity per
condition (Figs6D and H, and EV5F).
Identification of ERK dynamics phenotypes using CODEX
To investigate ERK dynamics phenotypes to siRNA perturbations,
we first trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify
input ERK trajectories into any of the siRNA-perturbed conditions
(FigEV3C). For this purpose, we used a CNN architecture composed
of 4 1D-convolution layers with 20 kernels of size 5, followed by a
convolution layer with 20 kernels of size 3 and one layer of 10 ker-
nels of size 3. The responses are then pooled with global average
pooling to generate a vector of 10 features that is passed to a (10,63)
fully connected layer for classification. Each convolutional layer is
followed by ReLU and batch normalization. The CNN was trained to
minimize the cross-entropy loss, with L2 weight penalty of 1e−3.
To identify siRNA treatments that induced a distinctive pheno-
type, we selected the 10 conditions for which the CNN classification
precision was the highest on the validation set (Appendix TableS4,
“CODEX accuracy”). To these 10 conditions, we also added the neg-
ative control (non-targeting siRNA (CTRL)). We trained a second
CNN, with the same architecture and training parameters, but lim-
ited to recognizing the 11 selected treatments to obtain a clear
embedding of these hits. With this new model, we extracted the fea-
tures used for the classification of the trajectories (i.e., the input rep-
resentation after the last convolution layer) and projected them with
tSNE (Python’ssklearn implementation, perplexity of 100, learning
rate of 600 and 2,500 iterations) (FigEV3D). We selected 10 proto-
type curves for each treatment by taking the trajectories for which
the second CNN’s classification confidence (i.e., the probability for
the actual class of the inputs) were the highest in the validation set
(Fig4E, “CODEX”).
To visualize the ERK dynamics landscape in MCF10A WT cells
and in MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2, we trained one CNN for
each cell line. These CNNs were trained to recognize the drug treat-
ment applied on cells, using single-cell ERK traces as input. The
architecture of the CNNs is the same as described previously. The
only difference lies in the number of outputs in the final fully
connected layer, which were set to the number of drug treatments.
Features used for the classification of the trajectories were then
projected with tSNE (Figs7D and H, and EV5J and K).
To identify clusters gathering similar ERK dynamics (Fig7E, F, I
and J), we clustered trajectories based on their CNN features using a
partition around medoids (PAM). This iterative algorithm is similar
to K-means clustering. PAM defines the cluster centers (i.e., the
medoids) as the observed data points which minimize the median
distances to all other points in its own cluster. This makes PAM
more robust to outliers than K-means which uses the average coor-
dinates of a cluster to define its center. Representative trajectories
were obtained by taking the medoids of each cluster and their four
closest neighbors (Fig7G and K). Distances between points were
defined with the Manhattan distance between the scaled CNN fea-
tures (zero mean and unit variance). We manually verified that
these clusters captured an actual trend by visualizing trajectories in
each cluster with the interactive CODEX application.
Peak detection and classification of oscillatory trajectories
The number of ERK activity peaks was calculated with a custom
algorithm that detects local maxima in time series. First, we applied
a short median filter to smoothen the data with a window width of
3 timepoints. Then, we ran a long median filter to estimate the long-
term bias with a window width of 15 timepoints. This bias was then
subtracted from the smoothed time series, and we only kept the pos-
itive values. If no point in this processed trajectory was exceeding a
manual threshold of 0.075, all variations were considered as noise
and no peak was extracted from the trajectory. The remaining tra-
jectories were then rescaled to [0,1]. Finally, peaks were detected as
points that exceeded a threshold which was manually set to 0.1.
Peaks that were found before the first stimulation or after the last
stimulation were filtered out.
The classification of trajectories into oscillatory and non-
oscillatory behaviors was performed after the peak detection step.
Cells were called oscillatory if at least 3 peaks were detected with
the peak detection procedure (Fig4F). Statistical analysis was
done using a pairwise t-test comparing each perturbation to the
control for high and low levels of optoFGFR independently,
with FDRP-value correction (* < 0.05, **< 0.005, ***< 0.0005,
****< 0.00005).
