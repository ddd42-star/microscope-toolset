Abstract
The GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 act in concert to control cytoskeleton dynamics1-3. Recent 
biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells4-7 
and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac18, 
and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory9-12. However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at 
the seconds and single micron dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains 
unknown. Here, we examine GTPase coordination both through simultaneous visualization of two 
GTPase biosensors and using a “computational multiplexing” approach capable of defining the 
relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that 
RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 
are activated 2 μm behind the edge with a delay of 40 sec. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA 
operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA plays a role 
in the initial events of protrusion, while Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in 
reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions.

Our computational multiplexing approach makes the critical assumption that the relationship 
between GTPase activation and the movements of the cell edge during constitutive 
protrusion and retraction cycles is preserved within a cell, and among cells. Thus, the 
initiation of protrusion and retraction can be used as a timing reference to indirectly 
determine the activation dynamics of multiple Rho GTPases: First, for each GTPase, the 
timing of activation relative to protrusion/retraction events is determined in separate 
experiments. Then, the activation timings of different GTPases are aligned, using protrusion/
retraction events as a common reference. GTPase activities were imaged in Mouse Embryo 
Fibroblasts (MEF) using biosensors for Rac14, Cdc425, or RhoA6 (Fig 1a-c; Supplementary 
Figs S1 and S2). The Rac1 biosensor was improved over the previously published version4, 
using a fluorescent protein rather than a covalently attached dye. Images were captured at 10 
s intervals, sufficient to sample the protrusion-retraction cycles below Nyquist frequency 
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
As reported before4-6, all GTPases, including RhoA, were maximally activated proximal to 
the leading edge. Visual inspection of time lapse sequences indicated substantial fluctuations 
in GTPase activity as the cell edges protruded and retracted (Movies 1-6). To quantify the 
magnitude and location of the fluctuations we extracted time courses of GTPase activity at 
multiple distances from the cell edge and quantified the extent of signal modulation (Fig 1d). 
For all three GTPases the modulation was highest at the cell edge, decreased monotonically 
within ∼2 – 4 μm, and then reached a plateau of baseline activity (Fig 1e-g). Rac1 displayed 
the least significant decay, mainly because of cell-to-cell variations in the extent of the 
region with high activation. RhoA, on the other hand, decayed tightly over 2 μm. Thus, 
GTPase activities are regulated most prominently within a few micrometers from the leading 
edge, supporting our hypothesis that these fluctuations are linked to cell edge movements.
To investigate how GTPase activation relates to edge movement spatially and temporally, 
we tracked the position of the cell edge13 and compared edge velocities with the biosensor 
signal in forty to eighty sampling windows moving with the leading edge (Fig. 1h; Movie7). 
The window width was set to 1.8 - 3 μm, the distance over which edge movements were 
correlated along the cell boundary, and 0.9 μm in depth, the distance over which signaling 
molecules bound to the plasma membrane would be expected to diffuse between 
consecutive movie frames14. Edge velocities were sampled every 400 nm (see Methods), so 
that 5 - 7 velocity measurements would fall within a window (Fig. 1i). Thus each window 
yielded time courses of both edge velocity and GTPase activation level (Fig. 1j), with 
independent measurements in each adjacent window. Changes in edge velocity appeared to 
parallel changes in GTPase activity (shown for the example of a Cdc42 data set), but with a 
time lag.
To study more systematically the potential relationships between edge dynamics (Fig. 2a, d, 
g) and GTPase activation we copied the data from the individual sampling windows along 
the cell boundary into activity maps13 (Fig. 2b, c, e, f, h, i). This data representation revealed 
tight correlation of morphological dynamics and GTPase activation. Protrusion and 
retraction occurred in a quasi-cyclic fashion with a periodicity of ∼100 s (Supplementary 
Fig. S3). As reported previously13, protrusion cycles propagated transversally along the 
leading cell edge (Fig. 2b, e, h). Both Cdc42 and RhoA cycled with similar periodicity

(Supplementary Fig. S3) and their activity maps visually resembled those of the 
morphological dynamics (Fig. 2f, i). Rac1 exhibited a broader time response 
(Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with a spatiotemporally more diffuse activation (Fig. 
2c). Quiescent regions of the cell edge (i.e. regions Q) exhibited low GTPase activity 
compared to protruding and retracting regions. Transitions between active and quiescent 
portions of the cell edge were sharp (2 – 3 μm) and were accompanied by a steep gradient in 
GTPase activity. Thus, this data suggests an immediate coupling of GTPase activation and 
cell morphological dynamics, in both time and space.
To quantify the coupling we computed, for every sampling window, Pearson's correlation 
coefficient between edge velocity and the GTPase activity, as a function of the time lag 
between the two variables. High correlation coefficients indicated a tight coupling of 
GTPase activation and cell protrusion/retraction events, whereas low correlation coefficients 
suggested a more remote relationship. Moreover, if a significant maximum correlation 
coefficient was obtained at a non-zero time lag, it indicated the relative timing of the two 
processes. For actively protruding regions, we observed significant correlation coefficients 
for all three GTPases. For Cdc42 and Rac1, high correlation values occurred predominantly 
at negative time lags (Fig. 2j, k), i.e. the activation of these two GTPases was delayed 
relative to cell edge advancements. In contrast, for RhoA high correlation values were 
narrowly distributed around zero time lags (Fig. 2l). Thus, RhoA activation appeared to be 
synchronous with forward movements of the cell edge. These results show that GTPases are 
activated over a fixed time interval relative to the dynamics of the leading edge.
To more precisely estimate the activation of the three GTPases relative to protrusion/
retraction events, we averaged the correlation coefficients over all sampling windows of a 
cell (Supplementary Fig. S4). A comparison between cells showed that despite substantial 
variation in shape and morphodynamic behavior, the relationships between GTPase 
activation and edge movements were preserved (Fig. 2m - o). To estimate the average 
timing between protrusion/retraction and GTPase activation across cells the correlation 
coefficients of individual cells were pooled and the significant maximum of a spline 
function fitted through the data determined (Fig. 2m–o, red curves; Supplementary 
Methods). A few cells displayed correlation minima at positive time lags, particularly with 
Cdc42 and RhoA (Fig. 2n, o, arrowheads). These were likely due to ruffling events in which 
GTPases reach a high activation level a few seconds before the lamellipodium is lifted off 
the substrate and the edge retracts (see Movies 3 – 4). Edge retraction generates a negative 
velocity in the velocity map, and hence a negative cross correlation with elevated GTPase 
activation. These ruffling events did not affect our finding that both Rac1 and Cdc42 
activation lag edge protrusion, whereas RhoA is activated during cell protrusion.
We speculated that the GTPases might be organized not only temporally, but also spatially, 
within the band of modulated signaling activity (see Fig. 1e-g). Therefore, we repeated the 
correlation analysis between protrusion and retraction events and activation of Rac1, Cdc42, 
and RhoA in sampling windows at various distances from the cell edge (Fig. 3a-c, see also 
Movie 7). Maxima of the correlation coefficients CM and the corresponding time lags Δt 
were determined for each distance and fitted with a smoothing spline (Fig. 3d-f). For RhoA 
the correlation coefficient was highest at the leading edge and monotonically decreased at

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
larger distances from the edge (Fig. 3f, blue line). At D > 2 μm the correlation coefficient 
was smaller than 0.2 (Fig. 3d-f, black dashed line), the 95% confidence level for correlation 
coefficients of individual cells (Supplementary Methods). Thus, beyond 2 μm RhoA activity 
is no longer related to protrusion events (Fig. 3f, arrow). Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were 
correlated with edge movements over a wider region (4.5 μm and 3.2 μm, respectively; Fig 
3d, e, blue curve). Interestingly, the highest correlation coefficients were found at a distance 
D = 1.8±0.7 μm for Rac1 and at D = 1.3±0.7 μm for Cdc42. The same distance D was 
obtained when identifying the distance with the shortest time lag between edge velocity 
fluctuations and GTPase activation (Fig 3d, e, red curve), which indicates the location of 
initial GTPase activation. These results indicate that both Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated at 
∼1.8 μm from the cell edge. The larger time lags and lower correlation coefficients at 
distances other than 1.8 μm suggest that the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 then propagates in 
anterior and posterior directions loosing the close coordination with edge movements.
Next, we estimated the between-cell variation of the cross-correlation time lag (Fig 4a) by 
bootstrapping 2000 samples from the residual distribution of the spline fit to the individual 
correlation functions in Fig. 2m–o. The time lags were consistently negative for all three 
GTPases, i.e. the peak in their activation was delayed relative to the protrusion of the cell 
edge (time lag to protrusion for Rac1: -41 [-61 -13]; Cdc42: -46 [-51 -39]; RhoA -6 [-8 -4] s; 
mean, ± 95% confidence interval as determined by bootstrap analysis). Hence, Rac1, Cdc42 
and RhoA each have a different timing of activation, which is well conserved between cells.
We were concerned that the measured spatiotemporal shifts of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA 
activation might be attributed to the different biosensor designs we used for each of these 
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1). Some designs might be more susceptible to competition 
from native ligands, affecting readouts of activation kinetics. Therefore, we titrated the 
concentrations of biosensor components (Supplementary Figs S8 and S9) and repeated the 
timing experiments using different biosensor designs for the same GTPase (Supplementary 
Fig. S10). These control experiments confirmed that neither the relative activation kinetics 
nor the localization were a function of biosensor design (see Supplementary Materials).
We also sought to validate the time shifts between GTPase activations predicted by 
computational multiplexing by directly observing two signaling activities in the same cell. 
To this end, we modified the Cdc42 biosensor with new fluorophores (Supplementary Fig. 
S6), enabling simultaneous imaging of Cdc42 and RhoA activation in one cell (Movie 9). 
The resulting four-channel image data provided unprecedented temporal and spatial 
resolution for the study of the coordination between two signaling molecules, without using 
the cell edge velocity as a reference. Here, fluctuation correlation analysis was valuable to 
harness the full potential of the new simultaneous imaging capability. The data from 
multiplex biosensor imaging was again analyzed locally in sampling windows at the leading 
edge. Averaging the correlation coefficients between the Cdc42 and RhoA time courses 
within one cell and over n=7 cells we obtained a time lag of -34 [-30, -38] s, i.e. Cdc42 was 
activated after RhoA (Fig 4b). This was within the confidence band of the computationally 
predicted difference between Cdc42 and RhoA activation (cf. Fig 4a), confirming that direct 
visualization and indirect inference of signaling relationships yield the same result.

Together, these data indicate the following dynamics of Rho family GTPase activation in 
one protrusion–retraction cycle (Fig 4c): RhoA activation increases and decreases in 
synchrony with protrusion and retraction. RhoA activation that is correlated with leading 
edge dynamics is confined to a band 2 μm from the leading edge. Cdc42 and Rac1 reach 
their peak activation with a 40 s delay relative to protrusion, and their activation is initiated 
1.8 μm from the leading edge. Rac1 and Cdc42 are temporally as well as spatially less 
coupled to protrusion. Cdc42 and even more so Rac1 maintain significant levels of activity 
during the retraction phase, such that lower levels of Rac1 activation overlap the onset of the 
next protrusion cycle. Rac1 and Cdc42 signals propagate from their location of initial 
activation in anterograde and retrograde directions via as yet unidentified mechanisms.
The delayed activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 suggests that in spontaneous cell motility, i.e. 
without active stimulation by growth factors, their primary role may not be in initiating 
protrusion, as is currently supposed15. While the early, low activation level of Rac1 we 
observe may still be sufficient for this role, the peak activities for Rac1 and Cdc42 are 
localized closer to the sites of maturating adhesions (∼1.8 μm behind the protruding leading 
edge16). Rac1 and Cdc42 appear to be affecting protrusion by regulating adhesion 
dynamics17-19, likely by reinforcing adhesion sites that are formed to balance increasing 
protrusive forces at the leading edge20. In addition, our data supports the notion that Rac1 
operates as an antagonist to RhoA12. RhoA activity is rapidly suppressed as Rac1 reaches its 
maximum activation. RhoA is usually thought to be a mediator of contractility. Here, we 
propose that the synchronized activation of RhoA with protrusion relates to a second 
function of RhoA as an initiator of actin polymerization at the onset of the protrusion-
retraction cycle, possibly via its ability to activate members of the formin family such as 
mDia21,22. In addition, the RhoA – mDia pathway is known to stabilize microtubules 
specifically in leading edge adhesions23. This may contribute to the activation of Rac1 we 
observed at adhesion sites, perhaps via positive feedback between microtubule growth and 
Rac1 activation24 and/or via the engagement of integrins that regulate the coupling of Rac1 
to its effector Pak125, which is known to exhibit mutually positive feedback18.
We present two complementary approaches to in situ analysis of cellular pathways. 
Simultaneous imaging presents unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution to explore the 
relationship between two pathways, while “computational multiplexing” enables correlation 
of many signaling activities. Computational multiplexing makes use of the spontaneous 
activation of pathways by random local changes in signaling molecules due to low level 
stochastic stimulation of receptors, variations in concentration, etc.. Thus it is potentially 
less perturbing than methods that rely on acute cell stimulation to initiate a signaling 
cascade. The sensitivity required to capture the coupling of spontaneous molecular activities 
is achieved for two reasons: First, by very local image measurement, below the diffusion 
radius of signaling molecules, our analysis captures the immediate relationship between the 
states of a signaling pathway and its morphological outputs. While the activity levels of 
pathway components and hence the pathway outputs may vary between cellular locations 
and between cells, the hierarchy and timing between pathway components are conserved. 
Second, measurement noise is greatly reduced by averaging thousands of local relationships

between activities. Together, these properties permit the pathway to be reconstructed despite 
significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity.
We chose to illustrate computational multiplexing for a pathway controlling cell 
morphology, enabling us to use cell morphological dynamics as a reference to align distinct 
signaling events observed in different experiments. However, the method is readily scalable 
to more and diverse activities. Relationships between signals can also be inferred in 
pathways without spatial cues. In this case, one of the biosensors may itself be used as the 
common reference in a series of experiments where it is imaged simultaneously in pairings 
with other biosensors. Again, the statistical approaches described for computational 
multiplexing will be useful to integrate into a pathway model the heterogeneous and 
complex responses made visible by simultaneous imaging of different biosensor 
combinations.
Methods Summary
Biosensors
The three biosensors were made and used as originally described 4-6, with modifications 
where noted in the text. The Cdc42 biosensor was modified for multiplex imaging by 
removing EGFP and replacing it with an Alexa750 dye. This produced a biosensor with 
wavelengths orthogonal to those of the RhoA biosensor. The new Cdc42 biosensor was 
fused to maltose binding protein to enhance solubility. For control studies a new dual chain 
RhoA biosensor was constructed by eliminating the linker in the published RhoA biosensor 
(see Supplementary Material).
Live cell imaging
Biosensors were imaged as previously described26,27. In order to obtain sufficient signal/
noise for multiplexing, cells with biosensor were filmed at 10 s intervals, using a 40×/1.3 
NA objective and binning, resulting in an effective pixel size in object space of 330 nm.
Ratiometric corrections
Raw images were aligned and noise-filtered to allow ratiometric correction of volume 
effects, bleed-through and variation in sensor concentration.
Image analysis
Corrected biosensor images were segmented and cell edge displacements tracked as in13. 
Sampling windows of 0.9 μm depth and 1.8 - 3μm width were constructed to follow 
morphological changes at a fixed distance from the cell edge. For each window, biosensor 
activation time courses were recorded. For windows placed at the cell edge, a time course of 
protrusion/retraction velocity was recorded additionally. Coupling of two activity time 
courses was analyzed per window by Pearson's cross-correlation function. Subsequently, for 
a cell the per-window correlation functions were averaged over all windows following the 
edge at a specific distance D (Fig. 1i). Per-cell correlation functions were averaged over 
multiple cells and statistically analyzed by bootstrap sampling to determine the significance

and time lag of the coupling between two activities. All procedures are detailed in

(a, d, g) Overview of cell morphology (in DIC) and evolution of cell edge positions (color-
encoded from blue (early) to red (late) time points). Scale bar: 5 μm. (b, e, h) Activity maps 
of edge movement: Velocity values along the edge are copied time point by time point into 
the columns of the map. Color coding: red = protrusion; blue = retraction. Quiescent regions 
of the cell edge are marked by ‘Q’. (c, f, i) Activity maps of Rho GTPase activation: Colors 
designate the activation level of the Rho GTPase recorded in a sampling window at D = 0 
μm. (j, k, l) Cross-correlation coefficients (color-coded) between edge velocity and Rac1 (j),

Cdc42 (k) and RhoA (l) as a function of the sampling window and time shift. (m, n, o) 
Temporal cross-correlation functions for individual cells (black). Red: Average cross-
correlation functions per GTPase resulting from a spline fit to the combined single cell 
cross-correlation functions; n = 11 cells (Rac1); n = 12 cells (Cdc42); n = 12 cells (RhoA). 
Arrowheads: some cells show negative correlation coefficients at positive time lags, likely 
associated with ruffling (see text).

Figure 3. Correlation of Rho GTPase activation and cell edge velocity as a function of time and 
space
(a-c) Cross-correlation functions between edge velocity and GTPase activation at D = 0 (red 
line), 0.6, 1.3, 2.5, 4.4 and 6.3 μm. Dashed line: 95% confidence level for correlation values. 
(d-f) Blue line: magnitude of cross-correlation maximum as a function of D (blue bracket in 
b). Red line: time lag of cross-correlation maxima as a function of D (red bracket in b). 
Dashed lines: 95% confidence interval estimated by bootstrap sampling of residual 
distributions to the spline fits (see Supplementary Methods). Grey area: region with 
correlation values below 95% confidence. Of note, time lags of cross-correlation maxima in 
this area are no longer meaningful. Data derived from n = 6 (Rac1), n=5 (Cdc42) and n = 5 
(RhoA) cells.

Figure 4. Spatiotemporal coordination of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA activation
(a) Timing of Rho GTPase activation relative to edge velocity, as determined by temporal 
cross-correlation functions. The variable ‘edge movement’ is being used as the reference 
signal. Thus, correlation maxima in the sector labeled “After” indicate that the GTPase 
reaches the activation maximum after the protrusion event (time point of fastest edge 
advancement). Dashed lines: 95% confidence intervals. Data originate from n = 11 cells 
(Rac1), n = 12 cells (Cdc42), and n=12 cells (RhoA). Confidence intervals were computed 
by bootstrap sampling of 2000 residuals to the spline fits. (b) Timing of RhoA activity 
relative to Cdc42 activity, both monitored in the same cell, as determined by the temporal 
cross-correlation function. The variable Cdc42 is being used as the reference signal. Thus, 
the correlation maximum in the sector labeled “Before” indicates that RhoA reaches the 
activation maximum before Cdc42 (n = 7 cells). (c) Model of GTPase activation during 
protrusion and retraction. Green: Rac1 activation. Black: RhoA activation. Blue: Cdc42 
activation.
