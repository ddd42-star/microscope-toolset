Abstract
Local mRNA translation in neurons has been mostly studied during axon guidance and synapse formation but not during
initial neurite outgrowth. We performed a genome-wide screen for neurite-enriched mRNAs and identified an mRNA that
encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) for Jun kinase (JNK). We show that
MKK7mRNA localizes to the growth cone where it has the potential to be translated. MKK7 is then specifically
phosphorylated in the neurite shaft, where it is part of a MAP kinase signaling module consisting of dual leucine zipper
kinase (DLK), MKK7, and JNK1. This triggers Map1b phosphorylation to regulate microtubule bundling leading to neurite
elongation. We propose a model in whichMKK7 mRNA localization and translation in the growth cone allows for a
mechanism to position JNK signaling in the neurite shaft and to specifically link it to regulation of microtubule bundling. At
the same time, this uncouples activated JNK from its functions relevant to nuclear translocation and transcriptional
activation.

Introduction
Local mRNA targeting and translation is an important aspect of
the regulation of axonal guidance and the remodeling of synapses
in the nervous system. In axons, local translation ofb-actin mRNA
has been implicated in growth cone turning [1]. Local translation
ofRhoA mRNA regulates axonal growth cone collapse [2]. Local
translation of the transcription factors ELK at the synapse [3] and
CREB in the axon [4] allows for retrograde signaling between
these organelles and the nucleus. Local mRNA translation is also
observed in response to neuronal injury. In this context, local
translation ofStat3 mRNA, and its subsequent retrograde shuttling
to the nucleus induces survival signals [5]. A combination of gene
expression profiling and neuronal process purification techniques,
has unveiled complex local transcriptomes that depend on the
neurite identity (axon/dendrite) [6–9], the differentiation state
(young versus old axons [10]) and on neurite injury [11]. This
suggests that a large variety of local translational programs
regulate distinct neuronal functions depending on specific cellular
states during development. However, local mRNA targeting and
translation has not yet been explored during the initial process of
neurite outgrowth, before axon-dendrite specification.
Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1–3) are a subgroup of mitogen-
activated kinases (MAPKs) that control transcriptional programs
and the neuronal cytoskeleton [12]. While JNKs were originally
considered to regulate neuronal survival or death in response to
stress and injury, significant JNK activity is maintained in neurons
even in the absence of stress [13]. Consistently, it recently became
clear that JNKs are essential regulators of neurite growth and
regeneration [14]. In this context, JNKs have been implicated in
the regulation of microtubule (mt) dynamics through phosphor-
ylation of a variety of proteins. JNKs phosphorylate and regulate
mt-associated proteins (MAPs), consequently, JNK1-deficient mice
display loss of axonal mt integrity [15]. JNKs phosphorylate the
catastrophy promoting factors stathmins [16] and the protein
SCG10 [17], which exhibits mt depolymerizing activity. JNKs also
phosphorylate doublecortins to modulate neurite outgrowth and
neuronal migration [18]. Finally, JNKs have also been implicated
in the regulation of axonal specification [19], which might be
regulated by the JNK scaffold protein (JNK interacting protein 1
[JIP1]) [20]. The three JNK isoforms are directly phosphorylated
and controlled by two MAP kinase kinase (MAP2Ks), mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase 4 and 7 (MKK4 and MKK7, [21]),
which are also known to be phosphorylated during neurite

outgrowth of cerebellar granule neurons [13]. Further upstream,
these MAP2Ks can in turn be phosphorylated by a wide variety of
MAP3Ks [21,22]. While it is clear that JNKs are essential for the
control of neuronal mts, the molecular details of how the JNK
signaling network is spatio-temporally wired to control distinct
(and sometimes opposing) mt regulating activities versus nuclear
translocation and regulation of transcriptional responses remains
unknown.
Here we perform a genome-wide screen and identify 80
mRNAs that are significantly enriched in neurites of N1E-115
neuronal-like cells. We identify the neurite-enriched MKK7
mRNA, which localizes to growth cones, where it most likely is
translated, and subsequently activated in the neurite shaft through
phosphorylation. We propose a model in which growth cone
localization of MKK7 mRNA, and possibly its translation at this
subcellular localization triggers a spatio-temporal JNK signaling
module in the neurite to specifically regulate mt bundling and
neurite elongation.
Results
Genome-wide Screen Identifies mRNAs That Localize to
the Growth Cone
To identify on a genome-wide scale neurite-localized mRNAs
during neuronal outgrowth, we used our previously described
microporous filter technology [23] to fractionate neurites from the
soma of N1E-115 neuronal-like cells (Figure 1A). Similar
approaches have been previously used to study local mRNA
translation in dendrites [24]. In this model system, differentiated
N1E-115 cells are plated on a 3-mm microporous filter that has
been coated with laminin on the bottom part (Figure 1A). This
leads to neurite outgrowth to the bottom filter surface, allowing
biochemical separation of neurites from the soma. Total RNA
from purified neurite and soma equivalents was analyzed by
Affymetrix gene chip technology to quantitate relative mRNA
abundance. This revealed 80 mRNAs that are significantly
enriched in the neurite fraction (Table S1), and encode a wide
variety of different functions (Figure 1B). To validate the
enrichment of mRNAs in the neurite, we used quantitative PCR
coupled with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to compare relative
mRNA abundance in both fractions and observed similar results
as for the gene chip experiment (Figure 1C). We also explored the
localization of a panel of these neurite-enriched mRNAs using
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments in N1E-115
cells (Figures 1D, 1E, S1A, and S1B). While some mRNA is
present in the soma, these mRNAs predominantly localized to
bright punctate structures in growth cones, suggesting association
with ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) [25]. Soma-enriched
transcripts consisted mostly of small nucleolar RNAs. FISH
showed that such a non-coding RNA,Snord15b, specifically
localized to the soma and was absent from the growth cone
(Figure 1F). Becauseb-actin mRNA was previously documented to
be localized in neuronal growth cones [1], but was not found in
our genome-wide screen, we also evaluated its subcellular
localization in N1E-115 cells (Figure 1G). Whileb-actin mRNA
was evident in growth cones, the bulk of the mRNA was in the
soma. Thus, our purification approach, which relies on relative
comparison of mRNA levels in purified neurite and soma
equivalents, will only detect transcripts that are robustly enriched
in the neurite, but will miss mRNAs of which only a small portion
of the total pool localizes to the growth cone. The control sense
FISH probes for all these transcripts exhibited very little signal
(Figure S1C–S1H).
MKK7 Activates a Spatio-Temporal JNK Signaling Module
in the Neurite Shaft
We chose to further study the functional significance of growth
cone MKK7 mRNA localization. As a first approach, we evaluated
the subcellular localization of total MKK7 protein (tMKK7) and
its activated, phosphorylated form (pMKK7). In N1E-115 cells,
tMKK7 displayed a cytosolic subcellular location and was
excluded from the nucleus (Figure 2A, upper row). In contrast,
pMKK7 was observed predominantly in the neurite shaft and
exhibited a decreasing gradient from the base of the neurite to the
growth cone, with a very sharp loss of pMKK7 at the base of the
neurite (Figures 2A, middle row, and quantitated in 2B and S2A).
This striking subcellular pMKK7 pattern was observed in
84.8%63.1% of cells observed (n = 2 experiments with 50 cells
counted in each experiment). A small pMKK7 pool was also
significantly enriched in filopodia, but to a much lower extent than
in the neurite shaft (Figure 2A, bottom row). Western blot analysis
of biochemically purified neurite and soma fractions also revealed
an increase of pMKK7 in the neurite, while tMKK7 was equally
distributed in both fractions (Figure 2C). In contrast, the
phosphorylated form of the other JNK-specific MAPKK MKK4
(pMKK4) was found to display a distinct distribution than
pMKK7, being high in the soma and the growth cone and
decreasing in the neurite (Figure S3A).
To further understand the role of MKK7 in neurite outgrowth,
we compared pMKK7, tMKK7, and MKK7 mRNA levels and
subcellular localization in non-differentiated (e.g., cells without
neurites) and differentiated N1E-115 cells. Western blot analysis
revealed an increase in pMKK7 level concomitant with differen-
tiation while tMKK7 remained constant (Figure 2D). Immuno-
staining revealed that this raise in pMKK7 resulted exclusively
from the neurite localized pMKK7 pool (Figure 2E). In both cases,
tMKK7 was excluded from the nucleus. At the transcript level,
MKK7 mRNA was found throughout the cytosol of non-
differentiated cells (Figure 2F). During differentiation, 53%63%
(n = 23 cells) ofMKK7 mRNA RNPs relocalized to the growth cone
(Figure 2F). Globally, these results show that there is an increase of
pMKK7 level associated with cell differentiation and neurite
outgrowth. This pMKK7 pool specifically localizes to the neurite,
and might therefore regulate cytoskeletal rather than nuclear
functions. At the same time, this correlates with a redistribution of
MKK7 mRNA from the cytosol to the growth cone.
Author Summary
MRNA transcripts are usually translated into proteins in the
cytosol. Some mRNAs, however, are first transported to
specific subcellular regions where they are translated to
perform localized functions. This is especially important in
highly polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we find that a
transcript encoding the signaling molecule mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) localizes to the
growth cone of neuronal processes, where it most likely is
translated. This is surprising, because MKK7 has been
linked to activation of transcription in the nucleus in
response to cellular insults. We find that growth cone
MKK7 mRNA transcript localization, and potentially its
translation at this subcellular localization, allows the MKK7
protein to switch its function and regulate the microtubule
cytoskeleton, which is necessary for neuronal outgrowth.
This occurs through the formation of a spatially regulated
MKK7 signaling domain in the neurite that performs this
highly specialized function.

We then evaluated the signaling events downstream of MKK7,
and observed activation of JNKs in the neurite. We found that
total JNK (tJNK) was evenly distributed throughout the cell and
excluded from the nucleus (Figure 3A). An antibody that detects
the activated, mono-phosphorylated form of JNK isoforms 1, 2,
and 3 (pJNK T183) specifically stained the neurite in an identical
pattern than pMKK7 (Figures 3A, 3B, and quantitated in S2B).
This striking subcellular pJNK T183 pattern was observed in
82.8%61.7% of cells observed (n = 2 experiments with 50 cells
counted in each experiment). In contrast, an antibody that
recognizes the dually phosphorylated form of JNKs (pJNK
T183Y185) prominently stained the growth cone (Figures S3B
and quantitated in S2C). Biochemical experiments showed that
both phosphorylated JNK forms were also enriched in purified
neurites (Figure 3C), and increased concomitantly with differen-
tiation (Figure 3D). Beyond the ability of these JNK isoforms of

being phosphorylated in the neurite, we also directly measured
JNK activity in single living cells using a fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter for JNK activation
(JNKAR) [26]. We observed JNK activity throughout the neurite,
including the growth cone, but not in the soma (Figure 3E). Time-
lapse analysis showed that this neurite-localized pool of JNK
activation was stable for timescales of minutes (Video S1). A non-
phosphorylatable JNKAR T/A mutant probe did not exhibit
increased FRET signal in the neurite (Figure 3E and 3F). The
observation that the FRET activation pattern does not precisely
recapitulate the striking pMKK7 and pJNK T183 patterns can be
explained because JNKAR is a cytosolic probe that will rapidly
diffuse upon phosphorylation, and because JNKAR can be
phosphorylated by all JNK isoforms. These results formally show
the existence of localized JNK activity in neurites.
We then evaluated the subcellular localization of multiple mt-
regulating JNK substrates in their phosphorylated form. Immu-
nostaining for the phosphorylated forms of MAP1b and MAP2
recapitulated the subcellular distributions of pMKK7 and pJNK
T183 (Figures 3G, 3H, and quantitated for pMAP1b in S2D). In
contrast, phospho-stathmin and JNK interacting proteins (JIP1
and JIP3, scaffolds for JNK signaling) localized to growth cones
and recapitulated the subcellular location of pMKK4 and pJNK
T183Y185 (Figure S3C–S3E). Phospho-doublecortin was homo-
geneously distributed in the neurite and did not display the
characteristic gradient exhibited by pMKK7, pJNK T183. and
pMAP1b and (Figures S3F and quantitated in S2E). This suggests
the existence of distinct spatio-temporal JNK signaling modules in
the neurite. Altogether, these results suggest a link between growth
cone localizedMKK7 mRNA and activation of MKK7 protein and
downstream effector pathways in the neurite.
MKK7 Controls Neurite Elongation by Regulating mt
Bundling
To study the function of MKK7 during neurite outgrowth, we
used RNA interference to knockdown (KN) MKK7 mRNA
(Figure 4A). This led to a potent reduction in neurite outgrowth
(Figure 4B and 4C). To explore if this is a global cell differentiation
or a specific cytoskeletal defect, we examined the cell morphology
of control andMKK7 KN cells. In the undifferentiated state, N1E-
115 cells display flat lammelipodial protrusions that are not
sensitive to MKK7 KN (Figure S4A). During differentiation N1E-
115 cells lift up, adopt a round and loosely adherent soma, and
extend neurites. Upon differentiation, MKK7 KN cells still
rounded up (Figure S4A, and quantitated in S4B), but were only
able to initiate short neurites that were still capped by a growth
cone (Figure S4A). Evaluating the dynamics of the neurite
outgrowth process using phase contrast time-lapse microscopy
revealed that neurites ofMKK7 KN cells were highly unstable and
frequently retracted precluding the formation of long neurites
(Figure 4D and 4E; Video S2). These results show that MKK7 is
an essential regulator of neurite elongation.
We then explored which cytoskeletal defects could be the cause
of this effect. Because, the signaling events downstream of MKK7
are highly likely to involve mts [15,17,27], we evaluated the mt
cytoskeleton in fixed, immunostained, as well as live cells
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin. Newly formed
neurites in control cells displayed highly parallel, mt bundles. In
contrast, neurites fromMKK7 KN cells displayed curly and bent
mts that were unable to coalesce in obvious bundles (Figure 4F and
4G; Video S3). MKK7 KN cells were able to recruit mts to the
growth cone (Figures S4C, quantitated in S4D) and did not display
any defects in centrosome formation (Figure S4E and S4F,
observed in all of 20 cells/condition). To exclude the possibility
that frequent neurite collapse is the result of a defect in actin
dynamics, we examined the F-actin cytoskeleton in growth cones.
In the morphodynamic state of extension, no obvious defect was
observed when F-actin density was quantitated in growth cone
filopodia (Figure 4H and 4I). This was also apparent when growth
cone F-actin dynamics were studied using the Lifeact-GFP probe
(Video S4) [28].
We conclude that MKK7 specifically regulates mt bundling in
the neurite, most likely to provide the rigidity necessary for
outgrowth above a critical length. This is consistent with the idea
that the JNK substrates Map1B and MAP2 [15], which are key
regulators of mt bundling, are phosphorylated in the neurite [29].
Identification of Determinants That Allow Growth Cone
MKK7 mRNA Targeting
To explore the functional significance of growth coneMKK7
mRNA localization, we identified the determinants, often localized
in 39-UTRs [7], which allow mRNA targeting to the growth cone.
Mapping of the MKK7 locus had previously revealed that
alternative splicing generates six protein-coding mRNA isoforms,
leading to proteins with three different N-termini and two different
C-termini [30]. However, in the latter study the 3 9-UTR
sequences were not taken in account. The ENSEMBL database
indicates the existence of two alternative 3 9-UTRs, a 138-
nucleotide-long 3 9-UTR1, and a 2,067-nucleotide-long 3 9-
UTR2. The latter 39-UTR2 sequence is generated by retention
of the intron situated between exons 13 and 14, leading to
insertion of a STOP codon at the end of exon 13 (Figure S5A). As
a consequence, 3-UTR2 containing mRNAs encode MKK7
isoforms with truncated C-termini. Furthermore, this also implies
that the 39-UTR1 sequence is contained within the 39-UTR2
(Figure S5A). Each of the six MKK7 isoforms contains the kinase
domain, and except for the report that two specific MKK7
isoforms display different kinase activity in vitro [30], their
functional relevance remains unknown [21]. In this work, we
collectively refer to the six possible MKK7 protein isoforms as
MKK7. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (39-RACE) showed
that 3 9-UTR1 containing mRNAs were expressed in non-
differentiated and differentiated cells (unpublished data). However,
no specific probe can be produced to detect these 3 9-UTR1
containing mRNA species, and it is not possible to measure their
abundance in different differentiation states. Higher levels of 39-
UTR2 containing mRNAs were observed during differentiation
using quantitative RT-qPCR (Figure S5B).
To evaluate the ability of these 39-UTR sequences lo localize
mRNA transcripts, we flanked these two sequences at the 39 of a
chimeric human b-globin construct that was previously used to
study mRNA transport to fibroblast lamellipodia (Figure S5C)
[31]. We then exogenously expressed these constructs in N1E-115
cells, biochemically purified neurite and soma fractions, and used
RT-qPCR to determine the relative enrichment of the exoge-
nously expressed mRNAs in the neurite and the soma. We found
that the 39-UTR2 allowed enrichment of theb-globin mRNA in the
neurite, while this was not observed with the 39-UTR1 (Figure
S5D). To study the function of these two distinct 3 9-UTR
sequences, we engineered siRNA-resistant, GFP-tagged human
MKK7 constructs that either remained unflanked, or were flanked
with 39-UTR1 or 39-UTR2 sequences at their 39 (Figure 5A). We
first validated the relative enrichment of the mRNAs encoded by
these exogenously expressed constructs using the neurite purifica-
tion assay, and observed identical results as with the b-globin
constructs (Figure 5B). Evaluating the subcellular localization of
these chimeric mRNAs with FISH using an antisense GFP probe,
yielded an additional level of complexity (Figures 5C and S6, soma

and growth cone mRNAs highlighted by black and red
arrowheads, respectively). Exogenously expressed MKK7-GFP/-
mRNA solely localized to the soma. While the bulk ofMKK7-
GFP/39-UTR1 mRNA also localized to the cell soma, a small
mRNA pool was also evident in the growth cone. By contrast, the
MKK7-GFP/39-UTR2 mRNA robustly localized to the growth
cone and was only marginally observed in the soma. This is
consistent with our data obtained with a FISH probe recognizing
endogenous transcripts containing the 3 9-UTR2 sequence
(Figure 1E). The contradicting results between our enrichment
(using the neurite purification assay) and our localization
measurements (using FISH) concerning the 39-UTR sequence,
can be explained because the MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 mRNA is
present both in the soma and the growth cone. Here, the large
somatic mRNA pool obscures the subtle growth cone pool in
neurite purification experiments in which neurite and soma
mRNA equivalents are compared.
These results show that both the 3 9-UTR1 and 3 9-UTR2
sequences allow for growth cone MKK7 mRNA localization.
However, in the case of the 39-UTR1 a large mRNA pool also
resides in the soma.
Growth Cone MKK7 mRNA Localization Is Essential for
Neurite Elongation, Robust mt Bundling, and Selective
MKK7 and JNK T183 Phosphorylation in the Neurite
We then evaluated the ability of these constructs, that allow
differential MKK7 mRNA localization, to rescue MKK7 function
in MKK7 KN cells (Figure 5D and 5E). While theMKK7-GFP/-
mRNA was able to rescue neurite outgrowth to some extent, it
could not restore the level of growth observed in control cells.
However, the MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 and 39-UTR2 mRNAs fully
rescued neurite outgrowth, demonstrating an important role for
growth cone MKK7 mRNA localization in this process. This was
also apparent when neurite outgrowth dynamics were evaluated.
Here, rescue withMKK7-GFP/- led to less stable neurite
outgrowth dynamics than with MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 or 39-
UTR2 mRNAs (Videos S5 and S6). Furthermore, neurite
outgrowth robustness correlated with the ability of the different
constructs to rescue mt bundling (Figure S7A and S7B).
Overexpression ofMKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 or 39-UTR2, but not
MKK7-GFP/- mRNAs, led to longer neurites (Figure S8A).
Western blot analysis (Figure S8B), and assessment of MKK7
fluorescence intensities (Figure S8C), revealed that all three
MKK7-GFP mRNAs led to similar MKK7 protein expression
levels.
To understand the relative contributions of the catalytic activity
of MKK7, and of the ability ofMKK7 mRNA to localize to the
growth cone, we also tested previously described constitutively
active (CA) S271D T275E and inactive (CI) S271A T275A
MKK7 mutants in the MKK7 KN rescue experiment [32]. We
observed that the CA MKK7 still necessitated 39-UTR1 or 39-
UTR2 sequences to rescue robust neurite outgrowth (Figure S9A
and S9B), suggesting thatMKK7 mRNA localization provides an
additional layer of regulation on top of basic MKK7 activation. CI
MKK7 was not able to rescue neurite outgrowth irrespectively of
the presence or absence of any 39-UTR (Figure S9A and S9B).
This indicates that both MKK7 catalytic activity, and MKK7
mRNA 3 9-UTR sequences are required for proper neurite
elongation, and excludes the possibility of independent function
of the 39-UTRs.
To functionally link these phenotypes with MKK7 signaling, we
evaluated subcellular tMKK7 and pMKK7 patterns in this rescue
experiment. At the total protein level, MKK7 exogenously
expressed from the different mRNAs all displayed identical
subcellular localization patterns (Figure S8D). High protein levels
were found in the soma (but were excluded from the nucleus), and
were decreasing in the neurite towards the growth cone. Different
pMKK7 subcellular patterns were however observed in response
to rescue with the different constructs (Figures 5F, quantification of
fluorescence profiles in S10A, quantification of fluorescence
intensities in 5G and S10B). While control cells displayed the
characteristic pMKK7 pattern that is focused at the neurite base,
and absent from the cell soma, MKK7 protein originating from
soma-localizedMKK7-GFP/- mRNA was mainly phosphorylated
in the soma and exhibited only diffuse signal in the neurite.
MKK7 protein originating from somatic and growth cone-
localized MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 mRNA was robustly phosphory-
lated at the neurite base and still to some extent in the soma.
Finally, as observed in control cells, MKK7 originating from the
solely growth cone-localizedMKK7-GFP/39-UTR2 mRNA was
exclusively phosphorylated at the neurite base as in control cells.
These results show a parallel between the specific subcellular
localizations ofMKK7 mRNAs and MKK7 protein phosphoryla-
tion, which in turn correlate with the robustness of neurite
elongation. Similar results were observed when the subcellular
localization of the downstream target pJNK T183 phosphosite was
evaluated (Figure S11).
Altogether, these results show thatMKK7 mRNA growth cone
localization is necessary for specifying neurite-localized pMKK7
and downstream pJNK T183 signaling domains, which in turn
modulate mt bundling and neurite elongation.
MKK7 mRNA 39-UTR Sequences Lead to Local Translation
within Neuronal Growth Cones
To address ifMKK7 mRNA 39-UTR sequences allow not only
localization but also translation in the growth cone, we took
advantage of a recently described sensor for local translation,
which consists of a membrane-targeted, photoconvertible Dendra2
fluorophore, PalX2-Dendra2 [33]. This sensor was flanked at its 39
with MKK7 mRNA 3 9-UTR1 or 3 9-UTR2 sequences and
exogenously expressed in N1E-115 cells. Rather than using

of the green fluorophore form, we illuminated the growth cone
and the first 50mm of the neurite shaft with intense green light to
bleach the Dendra2 fluorophore. Because membrane targeted
proteins diffuse at a rate of,50 mm/h [34], any newly green
fluorescence appearing in the growth cone in a period of less than
1 h should derive from locally translated protein. We observed
that PalX2-Dendra2 was exclusively present at the plasma
membrane, and absent from vesicular structures, excluding the
possibility that trafficking might be the source of any growth cone
fluorescence recovery (Figure S12A; Video S7). The PalX2-
Dendra2 reporters were also expressed at identical levels allowing
for a fair comparison between the different constructs (Figure
S12B). We found that PalX2-Dendra2 not flanked with any 39-
UTR sequence poorly recovered fluorescence post bleaching,
whereas 39-UTR1 or 2 flanked reporters displayed robust green
fluorescence growth cone recovery (Figure 6A–6C; Video S8). The
amplitude and kinetics of fluorescence recovery were comparable
to those observed for local translation of RanBP1 mRNA in
response to neuronal injury [35]. Furthermore, this fluorescence
recovery was sensitive to the translation inhibitor anisomycin
(Figure 6D–6F).
These results formally show that the 39-UTR1 and 39-UTR2
sequences in theMKK7 mRNA leads to growth cone translation.
Functional Characterization of a Neurite-Localized JNK
Signaling Module
MKK7 is likely to interact with a large signaling network
including multiple MAPKKKs, MAPKKs, MAPKs, phosphatas-
es, scaffold proteins, and mt-regulating JNK substrates. To
pinpoint the specific JNK signaling module that controls mt
bundling and neurite elongation, we mined our previously
published neurite and soma N1E-115 proteome dataset [23] for
neurite-localized JNK interacting proteins (Figure 7A; Table S2).
We then performed an siRNA screen targeting these gene
products and evaluated neurite length and dynamics. The screen
was performed in triplicate and some variation was observed
(Figure S13A–S13C). KN efficiency was assessed when antibodies
were available (Figure S13D). We found that KN of the
MAPKKK dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK, MAP3K12), JNK1
(MAPK8), and MAP1b (MAP1B) always recapitulated theMKK7
KN phenotype in terms of neurite length (Figure 7B and 7C),
instable neurite outgrowth (Video S9), and loss of mt-bundling in
the neurite (Figure 7D and 7E). KN of the other gene products
did not lead to any obvious phenotype. Indeed, we cannot rule
out that in some cases, we might miss some phenotypes because
of low KN efficiency or penetrance. We also observed that the
MAPKKK DLK displayed similar subcellular localization at the
protein level as pMKK7, pJNK T183, and pMAP1b (Figures 7F,
7G, and S2F), further suggesting that DLK, MKK7, JNK1, and
MAP1b are part of a JNK signaling network controlling neurite
elongation.
To formally address the possibility that these components are
organized in a linear signaling module, we systematically knocked
down all signaling network components one by one using siRNA
and used immunostaining to evaluate pMKK7, pJNK T183, and
pMAP1b status, comparing short neurites from control and KN
cells. As controls, we also evaluated pMKK4 status, and
performed identical experiments inJNK2 KN cells. DLK and
MKK7 KN led to loss of pMKK7, pJNK T183, and pMAP1b
signals in neurites (Figures S14 and S15). Consistently with the
hierarchy of the proposed signaling network,JNK1 KN did not
affect neurite-localized pMKK7, but led to loss of pJNK1 and
pMAP1b signals (Figure S16).JNK2 KN did not affect phosphor-
ylation of any of the signaling network components (Figure S17),
neither were pMKK4 signals affected in response to KN of the
different components (Figures S14, S15, S16, S17). Globally, these
results formally show that DLK, MKK7, and JNK1 are a part of a
linear JNK signaling network dedicated to MAP1b phosphoryla-
tion in the neurite, allowing for mt bundling and efficient neurite
elongation.
JNK Signaling Network in Hippocampal Neurons
We then explored if the above described signaling network also
operates in E18 mouse hippocampal neurons, which is a well-
characterized model system for neurite outgrowth and axonal
specification. For that purpose, we used day in vitro (DIV) 1
neurons, a stage at which cells mostly exhibit short neurites that
are on the verge of axon specification.MKK7 mRNA containing
punctate structures were prominently enriched in neuronal growth
cones whereas faint signal was observed in the soma (Figure 8A
and 8B). This was observed with a FISH probe directed against
the 39-UTR2 region. DLK, pMKK7, pJNK T183, pJNK
T183Y185, and Map1b localized in all neurites with identical
subcellular localizations as in N1E-115 neuronal-like cells
(Figure 8C and 8D). We then studied the function of MKK7 in
hippocampal neurons. MKK7 KN led to reduced neurite
outgrowth when evaluated in hippocampal neurons at DIV 1
(Figure S18A–S18C). This correlated with loss of the ability of mts
to bundle in the neurite (Figures 9A and S18D). These results show
that MKK7 performs identical functions in hippocampal neurons
and N1E-115 cells.
To address if growth coneMKK7 mRNA localization is also a
relevant mechanism for neurite elongation in hippocampal
neurons, we performedMKK7 rescue experiments. Here, we
evaluated the hippocampal neurons at DIV 2 in order to explore
any potential effects on axonal specification. Using FISH, we
observed that exogenously expressedGFP or MKK7-GFP/-
mRNAs selectively localized to the soma, whileMKK7-GFP/39-

UTR1 and 39-UTR2 mRNAs displayed punctate signals in the
growth cone, as well as diffuse signal in the soma (Figure S19).
Rescue with theMKK7-GFP/- and MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 mRNAs
led to longer neurites, but not to the extent observed in control
cells. In contrast, theMKK7-GFP/39-UTR2 mRNA enabled full
rescue of neurite outgrowth (Figure 9B and 9C). To explore any
impact on axonal specification, we scored the relative number of
cells in different differentiation states as classically described by
Dotti and Banker [36]. We found thatMKK7 KN led to a decrease
in the number of neurons that had specified their axon (Figure 9D).

Intermediate levels of axonal specification were observed with the
MKK7-GFP/- and MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1 mRNAs, while full rescue
was observed with theMKK7-GFP/39-UTR2 mRNA (Figure 9D).
Importantly, all stage 3 neurons retained the ability of specifying a
single axon. Finally, we correlated these responses with the
subcellular localization of pMKK7 and tMKK7 in the rescue
experiment (Figure 9E and 9F). MKK7 originating from somati-
cally localized MKK7-GFP/- mRNA and MKK7-GFP/39-UTR1
were aberrantly phosphorylated in the cell soma and to a low extent
in the neurite. In contrast, MKK7 originating fromMKK7-GFP/39-
UTR2 mRNA was specifically and robustly phosphorylated in the
neurite but not in the soma (Figure 9E and 9F). MKK7 proteins
originating from all three mRNAs were mostly localized in the
soma, and displayed similar expression levels as endogenous MKK7
protein (Figure 9E and 9G). We also observed that the subcellular
patterns of the downstream target pJNK T183 paralleled those of
pMKK7 (Figure S20) in the MKK7 rescue experiment. These
experiments show a strong correlation between pMKK7 subcellular
localization, neurite outgrowth, and axonal specification rescue.
These results are however slightly different than in N1E-115 cells.
First, in hippocampal neurons, exogenously expressedMKK7-GFP/
39-UTR1 and 39-UTR2 mRNAs localize to both the soma and
growth cone. Second, only theMKK7-GFP/39-UTR2 mRNA allows
for robust MKK7 phosphorylation in the neurite and full rescue of
neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons.
Globally, these results show that growth coneMKK7 mRNA
localization is a conserved mechanism for mt bundling and neurite
elongation in both N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons.
Discussion
Localized Transcriptomes during Neurite Outgrowth
Fine tuning of local proteomes through mRNA localization and
translation is a widely used mechanism in neurons. In highly
polarized neuronal cells, the general view is that local mRNA
translation allows axonal or dendritic compartments to rapidly
respond to extrinsic signals such as chemotropic responses or
regeneration after injury. Because these compartments are distant
from the soma, this allows them to bypass the need for recruitment
of somatically translated proteins. Here, we identify a set of 80
mRNAs that localize to neuronal processes during the initial
neurite outgrowth process. This suggests that even in these
relatively undifferentiated cellular compartments, in which diffu-
sion of somatically translated proteins most likely is not limiting,
anchoring of mRNAs at specific subcellular regions and, possibly,
their local translation plays a role in cell morphogenesis.
Consistently, it is important to note that mRNA translation
paradigms have also been observed in cell systems in which
diffusion of cytosolically translated proteins is not limiting. One
important example isb-actin mRNA translation at the leading edge
of motile fibroblasts [37].
These mRNAs encode a large variety of different signaling,
cytoskeletal, motor, and trafficking proteins that are consistent
with local functions in the neurite. Some of these mRNAs have
also been found in fibroblast lamellipodia [31], in axons from
retinal neurons [10], and axons from embryonic or adult sensory
neurons (Table S1) [11]. Globally, these studies hint that complex
local transcriptomes exist in neuronal processes that will need to be
further studied.
MKK7 mRNA Localization Regulates Spatio-Temporal
Activation of a JNK Signaling Network Controlling mt
Bundling and Neurite Elongation
We explored the function of growth cone localization of an
mRNA that encodes MKK7, a MAPKK for JNKs. We found that
MKK7 mRNA localization is essential for its selective phosphor-
ylation and activation within the neurite. At this location, it
functions within a spatio-temporal JNK signaling network that we
identify to contain DLK (MAP3K), MKK7 (MAP2K), and JNK1
(MAP1K) leading to MAP1b phosphorylation, which then controls
mt bundling in the neurite to allow its elongation.
Evidence for this spatio-temporal signaling mechanism stems
from the observations that the products of MKK7 mRNA
engineered to have somatic and/or growth cone localization are
phosphorylated at these specific subcellular localizations. In our
N1E-115 rescue experiment, unlike in wild-type (wt) cells,
somatically localized MKK7 mRNA (originating from the
MKK7-GFP/- construct) is aberrantly phosphorylated in the
soma. Some weak neurite pMKK7 signal is also observed in the
neurite, most likely resulting from diffusion from the soma, and
might allow for the limited rescue of the neurite elongation
phenotype. In contrast, MKK7 mRNA with robust growth cone
localization (originating from the MKK7-GFP/3 9-UTR2 con-
struct) leads to exclusive phosphorylation in the neurite, and allows
for robust rescue of neurite elongation. Here, the specific pMKK7
signal also exhibits the characteristic gradient (high at the neurite
base decreasing towards the growth cone) as observed in wt cells.
Finally, theMKK7 mRNA species containing the 39-UTR1, which
localizes to both the growth cone and the soma, leads to MKK7
phosphorylation at both subcellular localizations and also enables
full rescue of neurite elongation. Identical results are observed with
pJNK T183, which is the substrate of MKK7, clearly showing that
spatio-temporal control of MKK7 activation is transmitted to
downstream signaling.
This mechanism for spatio-temporal control of MKK7
activity is also observed in primary hippocampal neurons, with
the difference that theMKK7 mRNA species containing the 39-
UTR1 does neither rescue neurite pMKK7 and pJNK T183
signals, nor robust neurite elongation. One possible explanation

neurite, is that it is translated at this location and subsequently
phosphorylated. This is supported by the finding that theMKK7
mRNA 39-UTR1 and 39-UTR2 sequences not only allow growth
cone mRNA localization but also translation. Furthermore, our
rescue experiments with CI MKK7 clearly show that both the
MKK739-UTR mRNA sequences, and MKK7 activity are
necessary for proper neurite elongation, excluding an independent
role for the 39-UTR. No obvious difference in MKK7 protein
levels and subcellular localization were observed with rescue of the
MKK7-GFP/-, /39-UTR1,o r /39-UTR2 mRNAs. This suggests
that only a small pool of MKK7 is locally translated (and
phosphorylated), which has been previously observed forb-actin
mRNA in axons [38]. We were however not able to formally show
that local mRNA translation is necessary for selective neurite
MKK7 phosphorylation and subsequent neurite elongation using
translation inhibitors. Bulk application of anisomycin did not affect
pMKK7 signals in a time window of 1 h, possibly reflecting the
existence of a stable pMKK7 signaling complex, until the N1E-
115 cells died (unpublished data). At the early differentiation stage
we are studying, it is not possible to fluidically isolate neurites using
microfluidic devices [39] to selectively apply translation inhibitors
to the growth cone. In the future, this might be studied using novel
chemical biology techniques that can specifically label newly
synthesized proteins [40].
Our results show that growth coneMKK7 mRNA localization,
and most likely translation, is a mechanism for spatio-temporal
regulation of JNK signaling. We present a model on how this
mechanism allows regulation of neurite outgrowth during initial

Figure 10. Model of localized JNK signaling during neurite elongation.In the undifferentiated state, in the absence of growth cones, RNP-
tethered, most likely 39-UTR1 and 39-UTR2 containingMKK7 mRNAs remain in a translation incompetent state. A somalMKK7 mRNA pool, most likely
containing the 39-UTR1 sequence, might allow production of the cytosolic MKK7 protein pool that can be engaged for stress responses. During
neurite initiation, MKK7 mRNA containing RNPs are transported to the growth cone where local translation occurs. Local MKK7 synthesis and its
phosphorylation by DLK allows to switch on JNK1, MAP1b phosphorylation, and mt bundling to ultimately allow neurite elongation.

Growth Cone MKK7 mRNA Localization

differentiation (Figure 10). This mechanism allows for several
important features for the regulation of neurite outgrowth.
First, our results suggest that growth cone MKK7 mRNA
translation provides a mechanism to specifically position mt
bundling activity in the neurite necessary for its rigidification and
proper elongation. This seems also to be important for generation
of the pMKK7 gradient, which in turn allows high MAP1b
phosphorylation at the base of the neurite. This might allow robust
mt stabilization and stiffness at this location versus more flexibility
in the neurite distal region that might be important for growth
cone motility. In that respect, it will be important in the future to
explore the molecular mechanisms that allow retention of pMKK7
in the neurite and the formation of the characteristic pMKK7
gradient. One potential mechanism might be that growth cone
translated MKK7 protein diffuses throughout the neurite and gets
phosphorylated by DLK, which displays an identical subcellular
localization than pMKK7. DLK might therefore be a key player
that shapes the specific pMKK7 signaling zone. However, the
observation that somatically-translatedMKK7 mRNA cannot
reproduce the characteristic pMKK7 gradient implies that there
are additional mechanisms, controlled by MKK7 mRNA local-
ization, that regulate the diffusion of this pMKK7 pool so that it
remains in the neurite. Furthermore, our experiments with CA
MKK7 formally show thatMKK7 mRNA growth cone localization
is essential for MKK7 protein function independently of simply
being in an activated state. One possibility is that locally translated
and phosphorylated MKK7 is endowed with specific post-
translational modifications and/or ability to interact with partic-
ular scaffolds that tether it to the neurite. One can also imagine the
local action of MKK7-specific phosphatases at the base of the
neurite. However, the underlying signaling machinery allowing
this spatio-temporal regulation remains elusive since our pertur-
bation studies targeting a potential MKK7-JNK interactome
(including scaffold proteins and phosphatases), suggested by our
previous proteomic analysis of the neurite [23], did not yield any
significant neurite outgrowth phenotype. Globally, these results
suggest that the function ofMKK7 mRNA localization and
translation is the formation of a specific signaling complex that can
activate a precise spatio-temporal MAPK module.
Second, while local mRNA translation has been mostly studied
in the context of acute chemotropic or neuronal injury responses
in axons, the mechanism we report here might continuously occur
during neurite outgrowth. We propose that localMKK7 mRNA
localization and translation allows for a cell-geometry dependent
mechanism to switch on the JNK pathway during neuronal
differentiation. Here, simple production of a growth cone, by
providing a platform forMKK7 mRNA translation, will trigger and
appropriately position pMKK7 and the specific MAPK module
leading to mt bundling. In that respect, there is evidence that local
mRNA translation is coupled with adhesion signaling which is
specifically taking place in the growth cone. Ribosomes, RNA
binding proteins and mRNAs have been shown to localize to
adhesion complexes [41,42] and regulation of b-actin mRNA
translation is regulated by Src-dependent phosphorylation of
zipcode binding protein in neurites [43]. An important conse-
quence of a growth cone mediated adhesion signal that switches on
local MKK7 mRNA translation, is that simple growth cone
removal due to neurite collapse is susceptible to switch off this
specific spatio-temporal JNK signaling network. Consistently, we
observe that neurite JNK activation is lost during growth cone
collapse using the JNKAR FRET probe (unpublished data). Thus,
this might allow to co-ordinate growth cone de-attachment with
mt unbundling in the neurite shaft during collapse. Finally, it is
important to mention thatMAP1b mRNA has also been observed
in neuronal processes [44]. This suggests that additional compo-
nents of the spatio-temporal JNK signaling network we have
defined might also be subjected to regulation by mRNA
localization and translation.
Third, growth coneMKK7 mRNA localization and translation
as a mechanism to segregate active JNK in the neurite also
provides an elegant mechanism for its uncoupling from nuclear
translocation and activation of transcription, which typically
occurs in response to cellular stress or neuronal injury. Impor-
tantly, in the latter process, retrograde transport of JNK
containing signaling endosomes from the axon to the nucleus
are used as a mechanism to switch on stress responses [14]. An
interesting question is therefore if neurite-tethered active JNK also
represents a reservoir that can be mobilized for retrograde
signaling in response to neuronal injury.
Function of MKK7 mRNA Species with Distinct 39-UTRs
As mentioned above (Figure S5), the MKK7 locus produces
multiple mRNAs that contain either the short 39-UTR1 or the
long 39-UTR2, and encode different MKK7 isoforms. It will be
important to explore the structural nature of theMKK7 mRNA 39-
UTR1 and 2 determinants, as well as the RNA binding proteins
that controlMKK7 mRNA transport and local translation. Our
preliminary bioinformatic analysis was not able to pinpoint any
RNA motif in the MKK7 mRNA 39-UTRs that could bind to
specific RNA binding proteins. Importantly, the 3 9-UTR2
containing mRNAs are generated by retention of an intron,
which has recently been shown to occur in a panel of dendritically
targeted mRNAs [45]. A correlate of this is that the 39-UTR1 is
embedded within the 39-UTR2 sequence. Thus, because both 39-
UTR1 and 39-UTR2 sequences lead to MKK7 mRNA localiza-
tion, this suggests that 39-UTR1 might contain a minimal growth
cone targeting motif.
What might be the functional significance of two different 39-
UTRs? The observation that 39-UTR1 containing MKK7 mRNA
species are predominantly localized in the soma suggests that they
provide the bulk of cytosolic MKK7 that can be used during stress
responses irrespectively of the differentiation state. The more
diffuse staining observed with chimeric 39-UTR1 constructs
suggests that not all mRNA is bound to RNPs. A subset of the
39-UTR1 containing MKK7 mRNA species however localizes to
the growth cone, and might initiate the JNK network upon growth
cone formation during the differentiation process. Such a dual
localization pattern (soma and growth cone) is also observed for
the b-actin mRNA in N1E-115 cells (Figure 1G) and, generally, is
thought to occur because RNA binding proteins are limiting for
packaging and transport of mRNAs to the periphery [46].
Surprisingly, 39-UTR2 containing MKK7 mRNA species robustly
localize to the growth cone, and are mostly absent from the soma.
It will therefore be interesting to study how this striking
localization pattern is achieved. This might involve low expression
levels and efficient packaging and/or mRNA decay in the soma.
This might be controlled by additional sequences in the 39-UTR2
compared to the 39-UTR1. We observe an increase in the level of
39-UTR2 containing MKK7 mRNA species during N1E-115
differentiation, suggesting a more specialized function in the
regulation of mts.
Function of Growth ConeMKK7 mRNA Localization and
of the DLK-MKK7-JNK1-MAP1b Signaling Module in
Hippocampal Neurons
Evaluation of the subcellular location of the signaling compo-
nents (in N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons), as well as the

mapping of the hierarchy in the signaling module (in N1E-115
cells), clearly identifies a DLK-MKK7-JNK1 spatio-temporal
signaling module leading to mono-phosphorylation of T183 on
JNK, ultimately leading to Map1b phosphorylation. This is
consistent with documented biochemical interactions: (1) DLK
preferentially phosphorylates MKK7 (versus MKK4) in vitro [47];
(2) MKK7 preferentially phosphorylate T183 (versus Y185) on
JNKs [48]; (3) Map1b is a direct substrate of JNK1 [15].
Our results show that growth coneMKK7 mRNA localization
also modulates this JNK signaling module in hippocampal
neurons. However, in this cellular context, only 3 9-UTR2
containing MKK7 mRNA seems to contribute to robust neurite
outgrowth. The MKK7 rescue experiment clearly shows a strict
correlate between neurite length and axonal specification.
Furthermore, the DLK-MKK7-JNK1 module clearly operates in
each neurite in hippocampal neurons. These results imply that the
JNK signaling module does not directly regulate axonal specifi-
cation, and that the axonal specification phenotypes we observe in
response to molecular perturbations are the result of modulation of
neurite outgrowth dynamics. This is consistent with experiments
using primary neuron cultures isolated from knockout mice that
show that loss of DLK [27] or MKK7 [49] impairs stage 1 to 2
transition, and subsequently, axonal specification. Importantly,
DLK was specifically linked to JNK1 in this process [27].
Our analysis of additional JNK signaling network components
in N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons suggests the existence
of a second spatio-temporal JNK signaling module that leads to
dually phosphorylated JNK T183Y185 specifically in the growth
cone, where it co-localizes with pMKK4, JIP1, and pStathmin.
Consistently, MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates Y185 (versus
T183) on JNKs [48]. In hippocampal neurons, there is clear
evidence that both dually phosphorylated JNK T183Y185 [19]
and JIP1 [20] become selectively enriched in the axon, and are
important for axonal specification. This therefore suggests the
existence of a distinct spatio-temporal JNK signaling module solely
devoted to regulation of axonal specification, and gives insight
about the complexity of spatio-temporal JNK signaling.
In vivo studies show that DLK, MKK7, and JNK1 loss of
function animals show defects in axon elongation. Loss of function
of each protein seems to affect axon fiber tracts, ultimately leading
to defects in commissure formation. Specifically, DLK knockout
animals display impaired fiber tract development by neocortical
pyramidal neurons in the cerebrum [50]. Conditional genetic
ablation of MKK7 in the brain leads to decreased forebrain axon
tracts [49]. Finally, in JNK1 knockout mice, axon tracts of the
anterior commissure first appear normal until postnatal day 6, but
then subsequently degenerate, suggesting a role for JNK1 in axon
maintenance [15]. These studies show that defects in the DLK-
MKK7-JNK1 signaling module lead to defects in axon outgrowth
in vivo.
In short, our results show that localization of mRNAs in the
growth cone, and most likely also local mRNA translation also
operates during neurite outgrowth, before the axon-dendrite
specification step. The function of MKK7 mRNA growth cone
localization, and most likely translation, is the positioning of a
specific JNK signaling module with a highly dedicated function in
spatio-temporal regulation of the cytoskeleton, allowing ‘‘insula-
tion’’ from other JNK signaling modules.
Material and Methods
Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (American Tissue Culture Col-
lection) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. For differentiation, N1E-115 cells were
starved for 24 h in serum-free Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin. Cells were detached with PUCK’s saline and replated on
coverslips previously coated with 10 mg/ml laminin (Millipore-
Chemicon). For experiments with primary cells, E18 hippocampal
neurons were isolated and plated on coverslips coated with poly-
D-lysine. For plasmid transfection, N1E-115 cells were transfected
as previously described [51]. For siRNA-mediated KN experi-
ments, 36105 N1E-115 cells were transfected with 100 pmol of
siRNA (Dharmacon siRNA Smartpool Plus) with 6 mlo f
Dharmafect-2 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) per well (six-well
plate) in presence of serum. 48 h post-transfection cells were
starved in neurobasal medium. 72 h post-transfection cells were
used in the different assays. For combinations of siRNA-mediated
KN and plasmid transfection, cells were transfected as previously
described [51] and 100 pmol of siRNA were added to the
transfection mix. In the MKK7 rescue experiments, a single
MKK7-specific siRNA (Invitrogen Stealth Select) was used for
KN.
Neurite Purification, Genechip, and RT-qPCR Analysis
Neurite purification was performed as described elsewhere [23].
For RNA extraction, the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey–
Nagel) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol. For
Western blot analysis, a 1% SDS buffer containing protease
inhibitors and 2 mM Vanadate was used. Genechip analysis of
soma and neurite total RNA was performed in duplicate. CRNA
target synthesis was done starting from 200 ng total RNA using
the WT Expression kit (Ambion, In Vitrogen Life Sciences)
following standard recommendations. The further steps were
performed according to manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix). To
select differently expressed genes a one-way ANOVA model was
applied. Genes were filtered on the basis of an adjustedp-value
lower than 0.01. For RT-qPCR analysis, 1mg of total mRNA
lysate was retrotranscribed to cDNA using the ImProm-II Reverse
Transcription System (Promega). RT-qPCR analysis was per-
formed using a SYBR green mix (Applied Biosystems), appropriate
primers, and RPL19 primers for normalization.
Immunofluorescence
N1E-115 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 80 mM PIPES,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8 containing 0.25% glutar-
aldehyde for 45 s and permeabilized in the same buffer containing
0.1% Triton-X for 10 min. Coverslips were incubated with 0.2%
sodium borohydride in PBS for 20 min, and blocked in 2% BSA,
0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 15 min. Cells were stained with
primary antibodies for 1 h, and then with secondary antibodies for
30 min (Alexa-fluor 488 labeled phalloidin, Alexa-fluor 546
secondary antibody, and DAPI for 30 min [all Invitrogen]). For
all the other immunofluorescence experiments, N1E-115 cells or
DIV 1 mouse hippocampal neurons were washed in PBS, fixed in
PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) for
20 min, and permeabilized in PBS containing 1% of Triton-X
for 2 min. Coverslips were then washed, blocked, stained, and
mounted as described above.
FISH
Labeled probes were generated by in vitro transcription from
restriction-digested plasmids using the DIG RNA labeling mix
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The FISH
protocol is described elsewhere [52] and was adapted with the
following changes: probes (1 ng/ml) were heated to 70uC for 7 min
Growth Cone MKK7 mRNA Localization
PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 18 December 2012 | Volume 10 | Issue 12 | e1001439
and incubated on ice for 2 min before applying to fixed cells; after
overnight hybridization at 65uC and extensive washes in PBS-
0.1% Tween, cells were blocked in blocking buffer (2% BSA PBS-
Tween) for 2 h; detection by TSA-Alexa488 or TSA-Alexa546
(Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and Analysis
All wide field microscope experiments were performed on an
inverted Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon). Phase contrast live
imaging of neurite dynamics: N1E-115 cells were replated on
laminin-coated glass-bottom multi-well plates (MatTek). 3–4 h
after plating, cells were imaged in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)
in a heated closed chamber. GFP-tubulin, JNKAR FRET, and
PalX2-dendra2 live cells imaging experiments: serum-starved,
N1E-115 cells transfected with the different constructs were
replated on laminin-coated coverslips for different times and
imaged in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml
oxyrase reagent (Oxyrase Inc.) in a closed chamber. FRET ratio
imaging was performed as described elsewhere [53]. In the
bleaching experiments, a FRAP3D module (Roper Scientific) was
used to bleach a region of interest with 488 nm laser light. Neurite
outgrowth analysis: automated neurite segmentation was per-
formed using Metamorph software. For confocal imaging of fixed,
stained samples, a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope steered
was used.
Bioinformatic and Statistic Analysis
The JNK signaling network was extracted from our previously
published neurite proteome dataset [23], using Ingenuity pathways
software (Ingenuity Systems). Only proteins that were enriched in
the neurite or found in the neurite and soma fractions were
considered. MKK7, MKK4, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 were used
as ‘‘bait’’ to discover proteins that can directly interact with them.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5
software (Mozilla Labs). For multiple comparisons one-way
ANOVA with Dunnet test with 95% confidence intervals was
used, for single comparisons a two-tail unpairedt-test was used.
Antibodies and Plasmids
For Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments the
following antibodies were used: anti-MKK7, anti-JNK1, anti-
JIP1, anti-JIP3 (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-
MKK7 (S271 +T275), anti-phospho-JNK (T183 +Y185), anti-
phospho-JNK (T183), anti-DLK, anti-phospho-MKK4
(S257+T161), anti-phospho-doublecortin (S28), anti eEF1A1,
anti-GluTubulin (all Abcam), anti-phospho-stathmin (S38), anti-
phospho-MAP2 (S136) (all Cell Signaling), anti-MAP2 (Milli-
pore), anti-a-tubulin, anti-MAP kinase activated (T1832Y185),
anti-ERK1 (Sigma Aldrich), anti-GFP (Roche), Alexa Fluor350
phalloidin, Alexa Fluor488 phalloidin, Alexa Fluor555 phalloidin
(all Invitrogen), DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Anti-phospho-MAP1b
was a gift from Fatiha Nothias (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie,
Paris). GFP-MKK7 (gift of Jiyan Zhang, Institute of Basic
Medical Science, Beijing) was mutated to confer siRNA
resistance. GFP-MKK7,b-globin (gift of Ian G. Macara,
University of Virginia, Charlottesville), and PalX2-Dendra (gift
of Gary Bassell, Emory University, Atlanta) reporters in
eukaryotic expression vectors were all flanked at the 39 with the
MKK7 39-UTR 1 and 2 sequences. JNKAR1 and JNKAR1(T/A)
genetically encoded FRET probes were a kind gift of Jin Zhang
(John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore).
Detailed construct maps are available on request.
Primary Neurons Isolation and Transfection
Primary neurons were isolated from mouse embryos at E18. In
brief, hippocampi were dissected, trypsinized for 15 min, and
dissociated by trituration. Per condition 500,000 cells were
transfected with 1 mg plasmid DNA and/or 50 pmol Accell
siRNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector I system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, cells were plated onto
coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine and analyzed after 1 or 2
DIV. For experiments in which CMV promoter-based expression
vector was used, low expression levels necessitated anti-GFP
immunostaining to identify transfected cells. Coverslips were then
scanned using high content microscopy. Neurite outgrowth
measurements were performed using metamorph by gating on
GFP-positive cells. Staging of differentiation status was performed
visually on GFP-positive cells.

names of mRNAs that are enriched more than 1.5 times in the
neurite versus the soma fraction are shown. Neurite or soma
localization of the products encoded by the different mRNAs are
also shown according to our previously published N1E-115 neurite
and soma proteomes [23]. Some proteins were not identified in
our proteome and are marked as non-available (n/a). Otherwise,
the ratio of the spectral peptide count in the neurite versus the
soma is shown, with positive values showing neurite enriched and
negative values showing soma enriched proteins. For one of the
protein, peptides were only found in the neurite (neurite unique).

pseudopods [31], in axons from mouse retinal neurons [10], or
embryonal or adult sensory neurons [11] are also shown. Finally,
the function of the different genes is shown.
