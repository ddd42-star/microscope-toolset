Flavonoids 
ABSTRACT  
The PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways are frequently mutated in metastatic melanoma. In a screen of over 
2500 plant extracts, the dichloromethane extract of Ericameria nauseosa significantly inhibited oncogenic activity 
of AKT in MM121224 human melanoma cells. This extract was analyzed by analytical HPLC, and the column 
effluent was fractionated and tested for activity to generate the so-called HPLC-based activity profile. Compounds 
eluting within active time-windows of the chromatogram were subsequently isolated in a larger scale to afford 11 
flavones ( 1 - 11 ), four flavanones ( 12 - 15 ), two diterpenes ( 16 , 17 ), and a seco-caryophyllene ( 18 ). All isolated 
compounds were tested for activity, whereby only flavonoids were found active. Of these, flavones were shown 
to be more active than the flavanones. The most potent flavone was compound 9 , that was displaying an IC
50 
of 
14.7 ± 1.4 µ M on AKT activity in MM121224 cells. The terpenoids ( 16 - 18 ) were found to be inactive in the 
assay. Both diterpenes, a grindelic acid derivative ( 16 ) and an ent -neo-clerodane ( 17 ) were identified as new 
natural products. Their absolute configuration was established by ECD. Compound 17 is the first description of a 
clerodane type diterpene in the genus Ericameria .   
1. Introduction 
Malignant melanoma is the most lethal dermatological cancer, and 
its incidence has increased rapidly over the last decades [1] . Various 
driver mutations have been identified in melanoma cells, in particular in 
the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase) and the PI3K/AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kina -
se/AK strain transforming kinase) pathways [2] . The BRAF (v-raf mu -
rine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) V600 is the most prominent 
mutation occurring in 50 – 70% of all melanoma [3,4] , and mutations in 
NRAS are found in 15 – 20% of melanoma. The PI3K pathway is esti -
mated to be affected in 15% of cases [5] . Given that the two pathways 
are critically involved in cell growth and proliferation, such mutations 
contribute to uncontrolled pathway signaling and, therefore, to cancer 
progression. 
Drugs specifically targeting mutated BRAF V600, such as vemur -
afenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib have been developed. Initial clinical 
results with vemurafenib and dabrafenib were very promising, however, 
patients relapsed after only 5 – 7 months of treatment due to drug 
resistance [6,7] . The combination of two MAPK/ERK pathway in -
hibitors, namely a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor, has been recently shown 
to improve survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate 
[8] . Nevertheless, the 5-year relative survival rate for advanced meta -
static melanoma is still only 29.8% [9] . A rational therapeutic option is 
to simultaneously target the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways. 
Therefore, new inhibitors targeting one or both of these pathways are 
urgently needed. 
We recently developed a high-content screening (HCS) pipeline to 
screen for MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors in two human 
melanoma cell lines, namely the well-established A2058 and the patient- 
derived MM121224 cells [10] . The A2058 cell line is bearing a BRAF 
V600E mutation and a PTEN deletion, while the MM121224 cell line 
bears a BRAF V600E mutation, and an NRAS Q61K mutation acquired 
after vemurafenib treatment [11] . The BRAF V600E mutation leads to 
increased MAPK/ERK activity, and the PTEN deletion to increased PI3K 
activity. The NRAS Q61K mutation results in Ras-dependent PI3K acti -
vation and, as a consequence, to increased PI3K/AKT pathway activity. 
These cell lines were designed to express genetically encoded kinase

translocation reporters (KTR) that report simultaneously on ERK and 
AKT kinase activity in individual cells [10,12] . A KTR biosensor consists 
of the kinase substrate binding site, a fluorescent protein for detection, 
and a domain that converts phosphorylation/dephosphorylation into a 
nuclear-cytosolic shuttling effect [12] . Thus, when a pathway is inactive 
(e.g. in the presence of an inhibitor), its biosensor is located in the nu -
cleus, whereas when its activity is high, the KTR biosensor gets phos -
phorylated and shuttles into the cytosol. This read-out enables to 
simultaneously screen for MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways 
inhibitors. 
A library of more than 2500 plant extracts was recently screened 
with this assay to search for new compounds inhibiting oncogenic ERK 
and AKT activities [10] . The dichloromethane (DCM) extract of Erica -
meria nauseosa (Pall. ex Pursh) G.L. Nesom & G.I. Baird ( Chrysothamnus 
nauseosus (Pall. ex Pursh) Britt.) [13,14] was found to significantly 
inhibit AKT activity in MM121224 cells [10] . E. nauseosa is a shrub 
widely occurring in arid regions of western North America [15] . Inter -
estingly, a wide range of natural products scaffolds, such as flavonoids, 
monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, labdane diterpenes, and polyacetylenes 
have been reported previously in E. nauseosa [16 – 19] . 
The HPLC-based activity profiling strategy [20] was applied to this 
extract. Compounds eluting in active time-windows were pinpointed as 
being potentially responsible for the activity of the extract. We herein 
report on the targeted isolation of all these compounds, and on their 
activity on AKT and ERK signaling in both MM121224 and A2058 cells. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. General 
HPLC-grade MeOH, MeCN, formic acid (FA) and dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) were obtained from Scharlau or Macron Fine Chemicals. Ul -
trapure water from a Milli-Q water purification system (Merck Milli -
pore) was used for HPLC separations. Solvents used for extraction, 
column chromatography and TLC were of technical grade and were 
redistilled before use. Reference substances of apigenin (ALEXIS Bio -
chemicals/Enzo Life Sciences), kaempferol, quercetin (both Sigma- 
Aldrich/Merck), luteolin (AdipoGen), hesperetin, isoquercetin (both 
Roth) were used. 
Normal-phase flash chromatography was carried out on a Puriflash 
4100 system (Interchim) consisting of a pump, a PDA detector, and a 
fraction collector. A glass column (46 × 7 cm i.d.) was packed with Silica 
gel 60 (15 – 40 µ m to pack column; 40 – 63 µ m for dry load of sample) from 
Merck. TLC plates (Silca gel 60 F254, Merck) were visualized under UV 
light and by spraying with 1% vanillin (Roth) in EtOH, followed by 10% 
sulfuric acid (Scharlau) in EtOH and heating at 110 
◦
C. 
Gel chromatography was carried out on a Sephadex LH-20 column 
(93 × 2.7 cm i.d.) (Sigma Aldrich/Merck) connected to a Kappa Isocratic 
pump (ECOM) and a C-660 fraction collector (Büchi). The column was 
eluted with 100% MeOH at a flow rate of 0.6 – 2.7 mL/min. 
Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a 1290 Infinity II 
Preparative LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies) consisting of a binary 
pump and an Agilent 1100 PDA detector in line with an Agilent 6120 
Quadrupole LC/MS detector. The column effluent was collected via a 
split (100:1) between HPLC column and detectors. A SunFire Prep C18 
OBD column (5 µ m, 150 × 30 mm, Waters) equipped with a C18 Prep 
guard column (10 × 30 mm) was used at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. 
Semi-preparative HPLC was carried out on a HP 1100 Series system 
(Agilent Technologies) consisting of a binary pump, auto-sampler and a 
PDA. If not mentioned otherwise, separations were carried out with a 
SunFire Prep C18 column (5 µ m, 150 × 10 mm, Waters) equipped with a 
guard column (10 × 10 mm) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. 
HPLC-PDA-ELSD-ESIMS analysis was performed on a LC-MS 8030 
system (Shimadzu) consisting of degasser, binary high-pressure mixing 
pump, auto-sampler, column oven, and PDA detector. A triple quadru -
pole MS (LCMS-8030, Shimadzu) and an ELSD 3300 detector (Alltech) 
were connected via a T-splitter (1:10) to the system. A SunFire C18 
column (3.5 µ m, 150 × 3 mm, Waters) equipped with a C18 guard 
column (10 × 3 mm) was used at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. 
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III NMR spectrom -
eter operating at 500.13 MHz for 
1
H and 125.77 MHz for 
13
C nuclei, 
equipped with a 5 mm BBO probe operated at 23 
◦
C. Spectra were 
recorded in CDCl
3 
(Sigma-Aldrich/Merck) or DMSO- d
6 
(Armar Chem -
icals), and analyzed using Bruker TopSpin 3.5 and ACD/Labs NMR 
Workbook suites software. Chemical shifts are reported as δ values 
(ppm), with residual signal as internal reference, J in Hz. 
Optical rotations were measured in MeOH on a P-2000 digital 
polarimeter (Jasco) equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and a 10 cm 
temperature-controlled microcell. UV and ECD spectra were recorded in 
MeOH (0.17 – 1.3 mM) on a Chirascan CD spectrometer using 1 mm path 
precision cells (110 QS, Hellma Analytics). HRESIMS data were 
measured on an LQT XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo 
Scientific). 
2.2. Plant material 
Aerial parts of Ericameria nauseosa (Pall. ex Pursh) G.L. Nesom & G.I. 
Baird (syn. Chrysothamnus nauseosus (Pall. ex Pursh) Britt.) were 
collected and identified by Matthias Hamburger on 12.08.1999 in 
Pinyon-Juniper-Woodland (1500 – 1700 m above sea level, east entry of 
Arizona State Route 89, near Yarnell AZ, USA). A voucher specimen has 
been deposited at the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of 
Basel, under plant number 23. 
2.3. HPLC-based activity profiling 
The in-house library extract of E. nauseosa (10 mg/mL DMSO) was 
microfractionated on an analytical HPLC system (Shimadzu) connected 
to an FC 204 fraction collector (Gilson) adapted for 96-deepwell plates. 
Three injections of the extract were carried out: 2 × 30 µ L (corre -
sponding to 600 µ g of extract) with only the PDA detector for micro -
fractionation, and 1 × 10 µ L with PDA-ELSD-ESIMS detection for on-line 
spectroscopic analysis and to generate the HPLC-based activity profile. 
Water with 0.1% FA (A) and MeCN with 0.1% FA (B) were used as 
mobile phase. The following elution profile was used: 10% B for 3 min, 
followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 27 min, and 10 min at 100% 
B. 24 microfractions of 1.5 min each were collected from min 2 to min 
38, whereby corresponding microfractions of the two runs were 
collected into the same well of a 96-deepwell plate. The plate was dried 
in a Genevac EZ-2 evaporator. 
2.4. Extraction and isolation 
Dried herb of E. nauseosa (83 g) was frozen with liquid nitrogen and 
ground with a Retsch GM 200 mill. The ground material was macerated 
under stirring at r.t. with CH
2
Cl
2 
(9 × 500 mL, 8 – 24 h each). The solvent 
was evaporated at reduced pressure to yield 10.3 g of dry extract which 
was stored at 4 
◦
C. 
The extract was separated by flash chromatography on silica gel by 
using a gradient of CHCl
3 
(A) and 40% MeOH in CHCl
3 
(B) at a flow rate 
of 25 mL/min. The sample was introduced as dry load (10 g extract 
adsorbed to 30 g silica gel). The following gradient was used: 0% B 
(0 – 10 min); 0% → 12% B (10 – 70 min); 12% → 25% B (70 – 130 min); 
25% B (130 – 160 min); 25% → 40% B (160 – 190 min); 40% → 75% B 
(190 – 220 min); 75% → 100% B (220 – 230 min); 100% B (230 – 275 min). 
The column was further washed with B and MeOH (C): 0% → 100% C 
(275 – 305 min); 100% C (305 – 410 min). Fractions collected (22 mL 
each) were pooled to 12 main fractions (A-L) based on their TLC pattern 
(MeOH/CHCl
3 
10:90). 
Fractions D (527 mg) and H (1580 mg) were submitted to prepara -
tive RP-HPLC [H
2
O (A), MeCN (B); 30 – 90% B, and 30 – 70%, respectively 
(0 – 30 min)]. Fraction D afforded 8 (11.1 mg, t
R 
17.0 min) and 15 (44.2 
T. Hell et al.

3
mg, t
R 
18.4 min). Fraction H afforded two main fractions H1 (80.1 mg) 
and H5 (53.0 mg). Fraction H1 was separated with semi-preparative 
HPLC [H
2
O (A), MeCN (B); 18% B.), Xbridge Prep C18 (5 µ m, 150 ×
10 mm; guard column 5 µ m, 10 × 10 mm, Waters)] to afford 2 (26.2 mg, 
t
R 
17.9 min) and sub-fraction H1b (17.1 mg). H1b afforded 1 (10.5 mg, 
t
R 
23.0 min) by using 45% MeOH at a flow rate of 3.5 mL/min. Semi- 
preparative HPLC of fraction H5 [H
2
O + 0.1% FA (A), MeCN + 0.1% 
FA (B); 40 – 43% B (0 – 20 min)] afforded 16 (9.4 mg, t
R 
14.0 min), 18 
(6.7 mg, t
R 
15.7 min) and 17 (11.9 mg, t
R 
16.5 min). 
Fractions E (1.4 g), F (0.5 g) and G (1.7 g) were individually separated 
on a Sephadex LH-20 column. Fractions [12 min (F); 10 min (E, G)] 
collected were pooled according to TLC patterns (EtOAc/Hexane 70:30). 
Fraction E afforded E1-E6, fraction F gave F1-F10, and fraction G afforded 
fractions G1-G6. Compound 6 (14.3 mg) was obtained from fraction F9. 
The following fractions were submitted to semi-preparative RP-HPLC 
using H
2
O + 0.1% FA (A) and MeCN + 0.1% FA (B) as mobile phase. 
Fraction E4 (31.5 mg) was separated with a gradient of 25 – 55% B in 30 
min to obtain 13 (3.2 mg, t
R 
16.0 min), 11 (2.0 mg, t
R 
27.7 min) and E4f 
(6.4 mg). Separation of fraction E4f with 47% B afforded 14 (5.5 mg, t
R 
12.0 min). Fraction E5 (92.8 mg) was separated with a gradient of 
30 – 50% B in 30 min to afford 12 (4.1 mg, t
R 
14.0 min) and 9 (7.6 mg, t
R 
28.9 min). Fraction E6 (15.7 mg) was separated with a gradient of 
30 – 50% B in 30 min to afford 10 (1.1 mg, t
R 
25.6 min) and E6b (2.4 mg). 
Fraction E6b was separated with 32% B to yield 7 (1.2 mg, t
R 
35.4 min). 
Fraction G6 (12.7 mg) was separated using 30 – 40% B in 30 min to afford 3 
(2.0 mg, t
R 
16.6 min). Fraction F8 was separated by semi-preparative 
HPLC using two different methods both on a Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 
column (3 µ m , 10 × 150 mm, Dr. Maisch). The first method consisted 
of 50% MeOH + 0.1% FA to afford 4 (1.4 mg, t
R 
50.0 min) and 5 (2.0 mg, 
t
R 
53.5 min). A second method using 50% MeCN + 0.1% FA at a flow rate 
of 3.5 mL/min afforded 5 (1.5 mg, t
R 
12.6 min). Compound 5 had a purity 
of ~80%.

2.5. Testing of bioactivity 
Bioactivity was measured using a high-content assay recently 
developed in our lab [10] . In brief, A2058 (ATTC-CRL-11147) and 
MM121224 [11] wild type (WT) cells were transfected to genetically 
encode ERK- and AKT-KTRs. For the experiments, cells were seeded in 
96-well plates and incubated with the samples (fractions, crude extract 
of E. nauseosa , or pure compounds). Afterward, cells were fixed and 
imaged with a high-content screening (HCS) microscope. A computer 
vision approach was used to automatically segment each cell and extract 
a ratio of fluorescence intensity in cytosol over nucleus as a measure of 
ERK or AKT activity. Results were displayed as normalized percentage 
inhibition (NPI). Positive controls for the A2058 cells were 20 μ M 
AZD5363 (Selleckchem) as AKT inhibitor, and 500 nM cobimetinib 
(Selleckchem) as ERK pathway inhibitor. For the MM121224 cells, 1 μ M 
GDC0941 (Selleckchem) as PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor, and 200 nM 
cobimetinib as MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitor were used. The negative 
control was 0.75% DMSO in complete medium. The compounds were 
tested in triplicate at eight different concentrations ranging from 
200 µ M to 1.56 µ M. Immunostaining was performed as recently re -
ported [10] . 
2.6. In silico predictions 
Physicochemical and ADME properties for all isolated compounds 
were calculated on the ACD/Percepta platform (ACD/Labs, 2020.1.1). 
ECD spectra were calculated in the following fashion. The initial

conformational analysis was performed with MacroModel (Schr ¨odinger 
Release 2020 – 2, LLC, New York) in two-steps, both employing the 
OPLS2005 (optimized potential for liquid simulations) force field in 
H
2
O. First, the global minimum of the input structure was searched over 
30,000 steps, which was then used as the input for a conformational 
search over 10,000 steps to find the six conformers with the lowest 
energies (20 in case of compound 18 due to its flexibility). The resulting 
conformers were used as the starting point for quantum mechanical 
calculations. Initially, the geometry was optimized and the energy 
calculated by applying DFT at the CAM-B3LYP/Def2SVP level of theory, 
and employing the SCRF method and the CPMC model for solvation in 
MeOH with the Gaussian 09 program package [21] . Then, excitation 
energy (denoted by wavelength in nm), rotator strength (R
str
), dipole 
velocity (R
vel
), and dipole length (R
len
) were calculated in MeOH by 
TD-DFT at the same level of theory. The depicted ECD curves were ob -
tained on the basis of rotator strengths with a half-band of 0.25 eV and a 
shift of the spectrum by + 10 nm using SpecDis v1.71 [22] . 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. HPLC-based activity profiling and identification of compounds 
The DCM extract of E. nauseosa was recently identified as a hit in a 
HCS of 2576 plant extracts for MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway in -
hibitors in melanoma cells [10] . This extract, tested at a concentration of 
75 µ g/mL in MM121224 cells, was shown to inhibit AKT activity with an 
NPI value of 0.32. The extract was then analyzed by HPLC-based activity 
profiling [20] . Thus, a total of 600 µ g of extract was separated by 
analytical HPLC and fractions collected in a 96-deepwell plate for ac -
tivity testing. The UV, MS and ELSD data were recorded in parallel. The 
overlay of the HPLC chromatogram with the bioactivity data provided 
the so-called HPLC-based activity profile ( Fig. 1 ) [20] . Microfractions 11 
and 13 both strongly inhibited the AKT activity (NPI values of 0.17 and 
0.39, respectively), whereas ERK activity was not affected by any of the 
fractions ( Fig. 1 ). Compounds eluting in these active fractions were 
targeted by preparative isolation. 
A scale-up extract of E . nauseosa was prepared from a larger portion 
(83 g) of plant material. The extract was subjected to a combination of 
different chromatographic methods, including flash chromatography on 
silica gel, gel chromatography, and preparative and semi-preparative 
RP-HPLC to afford a total of 18 compounds ( Fig. 2 and 3 ), 14 of 
which were eluting in one of the two active time windows of the activity 
profile. The minor compounds 7 and 12 were also obtained during this 
isolation process. Compounds 1 and 2 corresponding to the two major 
UV absorbing peaks outside of the active time windows were also iso -
lated Fig. 1 . 
The UV spectra of compounds 1 - 11 exhibited UV spectra typical for 
flavones, with two major absorption maxima in the regions of 
250 – 272 nm and 310 – 370 nm [23] . Compounds 12 - 15 had absorption 
maxima at 288 - 294 nm with a broad shoulder at 320 – 360 nm, sug -
gesting the presence of flavanones/flavanols [23] . In contrast, com -
pounds 16 - 18 showed only one absorption maximum in the region of 
200 – 233 nm. 
Compounds 12 - 15 displayed signals of aliphatic protons between δ
H 
2.78 – 5.93, and carbons between δ
C 
42.1 – 83.0 ppm, typical for flava -
nones [23] . In contrast, the chemical shifts of C-2 of 1 - 11 appeared in 
the downfield region between δ
C 
145.5 – 155.5 ppm, confirming the 
presence of flavones. 
In the 
1
H NMR spectra of compounds 1 - 15 , resonances for aromatic 
protons of ring A ( δ
H 
5.86 – 6.48) and ring B ( δ
H 
6.94 – 8.16) were 
observed. In addition, the spectra of compounds 1 , 3 - 9 , and 12 showed 
signals of an ABX system between δ
H 
6.94 and 7.80, for the protons in 
the ring B. The 
1
H NMR data of compound 2 showed a typical A
2
B
2 
pattern (H-2'/H-6' and H-3'/H-5', δ
H 
7.92 and 6.95). Compounds 10 , 11, 
and 13 - 15 all showed resonances of five protons between δ
H 
7.39 – 8.16, 
thereby suggesting that ring B was not substituted. Most of the flavo -
noids ( 1 - 9 , 11, 12 ) were methoxylated, as suggested by the presence of 
singlets at δ
H 
3.72 - 3.86 integrating for three protons each. 
The relative configuration of flavanonols 12 - 14 was determined 
based on the vicinal coupling constant J
2,3 
> 11 Hz indicative of a trans 
position. Complete NMR spectral assignments were achieved by 1D and 
2D NMR, and the absolute configuration of flavanones was established by 
ECD. The experimental spectra of compounds 12 – 14 showed a negative 
cotton effect at 290 nm and a positive cotton effect at 330 nm. This was in 
line with calculated spectra for the (2 R ,3 R ) configuration ( S1, Supporting 
Information ). Flavanone 15 was established in comparison with the 
calculated spectra to have a 2 S configuration ( S1, Supporting Informa -
tion ). The flavonoids were thus identified as 7,4'-dihydroxy-3,5,8,3'-tet -
ramethoxyflavone ( 1 ) [24,25] , 7,4'-dihydroxy-3,5,8-trimethoxyflavone 
( 2 ) [26] , isorhamnetin ( 3 ) [27] , 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-3,8,4'-trimethoxy -
flavone ( 4 ) [28,29] , 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3,8,3'-trimethoxyflavone ( 5 ) [30] , 
5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyflavone ( 6 ) [31] , 3,5,7-trihydroxy-3', 
4'-dimethoxyflavone ( 7 ) [32] , 5,7-dihydroxy-3,8,3',4'-tetramethoxy -
flavone ( 8 ) [30] , 5,7-dihydroxy-3,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone ( 9 ) [33] , gal -
angin ( 10 ) [34] , 5,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone ( 11 ) [35] , (2 R ,3 R )-3', 
4'-O-dimethyltaxifolin ( 12 ) [36,37] , pinobanksin ( 13 ) [34] ,

The flavonoids 3 , 6 , 9 and 15 have been described previously from 
E. nauseosa [17,40] , whereas 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 and 10 - 14 are new to the genus 
Ericameria . Flavonol 2 has been previously reported as a synthetic com -
pound but, to our knowledge, not as a naturally occurring compound

, a formula 
requiring five degrees of unsaturation. The NMR data revealed the 
presence of three sp
2 
carbons (one carbonyl and two olefinic carbons) 
and thus suggested a tricyclic ring system. The 
1
H NMR spectrum 
showed resonances attributed to one olefinic proton ( δ
H 
5.64), two 
methine ( δ
H 
1.61, 3.91), six non-equivalent methylene ( δ
H 
1.50/1.81, 
1.18/1.78, 1.85/2.11, 1.99/2.17, 2.00/2.07, 2.59/2.71), and five 
methyl groups ( δ
H 
0.88, 0.95, 0.96, 1.41, 1.79). The 
13
C NMR data in 
addition revealed the presence of a carboxylic acid moiety ( δ
C 
171.5). In 
the HMBC spectrum crosspeaks were observed from H
3
-17 to C-7, C-8 
and C-9, from H
3
-20 to C-9 and C-10, as well as from H
3
-18 and H
3
-19 to 
C-3, C-4 and C-5. From these data, the scaffold of 16 was identified as a 
labdane diterpene ( Fig. 4 A). The COSY spectrum showed couplings be -
tween protons H
2
-1/H
3
-20, H
2
-1/H-2, H-2/H
2
-3, as well as between H- 
5/H
2
-6, H
2
-6/H-7, and H-7/H
3
-17 which corroborated rings A and B of 
the labdane, and confirmed the presence of a hydroxy group at C-2 and a 
double bond between C-7 and C-8 ( Fig. 4 A). The remaining NMR signals 
for the carboxylic acid, a quaternary carbon, three methylene and a 
methyl group were assigned to the side chain. The COSY crosspeak be -
tween H
2
-11/H
2
-12, and HMBC correlations from H
2
-11 to C-9 and C- 
13, as well as from H
3
-16 to C-12, C-13 and C-14 revealed the presence 
of a pentacyclic ether between C-9 and C-13. Finally, HMBC correlations 
from H
2
-14 to the carbonyl C-15 led to the planar structure of 16 . 
The relative configuration was established with the aid of a NOESY 
spectrum ( Fig. 4 B), where crosspeaks of H
3
-20 with H
3
-19 and H
2
-11, 
and of H-5 with H-1a, H-6a, and H
3
-18 were indicative of a chair-chair 
configuration of the decalin substructure [41] . Moreover, a NOESY 
contact between H
3
-20 and H-2 indicated the hydroxyl group to be in 
α -position. The ether bridge between C-9 and C-13 resulted in a tetra -
hydrofuran ring with a spiro junction at C-9. The relative configuration 
at C-13 was established via NOESY crosspeaks observed between H
3
-16 
and H-1a, and between H-14b and H
3
-17. 
The ECD spectrum displayed a negative cotton effect at 200 nm 
( Fig. 4 C). In comparison with calculated spectra, the absolute configu -
ration of 16 was determined as (2 S ,5 S ,9 R ,10 S ,13 S )-2-hydroxygrindelic 
acid. The best of our knowledge this is the first report of a 2-hydroxy -
grindelic acid bearing the hydroxy moiety in α -position.

( δ

H

were present. Additionally, in the 
13
C NMR spectrum the resonance of a 
carboxylic acid moiety ( δ
C 
177.7 ppm) was detected. The attachment of 
the aldehyde at C-4, and methyl groups linked to C-5, C-8 and C-9 were 
confirmed by key HMBC correlations from H-18 to C-3, C-4, and C-5, 
from H
3
-19 to C-4, C-5, C-6, and C-10, from H
3
-17 to C-7, C-8, and C9, 
and from H
3
-20 to C-8, C-9, and C-10. Taken together, these data sug -
gested compound 17 to be a clerodane diterpene ( Fig. 5 A). In the COSY 
spectrum a contiguous spin system between H-10 to H-3 was observed, 
which established the position of the hydroxy group at C-2 and the 
double bond between C-3 and C-4. A 3-methyl pentanoic acid moiety as 
the side chain was identified with the aid of HMBC and COSY correla -
tions, and an HMBC cross-peak between H
3
-20 and C-11 confirmed the 
side chain to be attached to C-9. 
The relative configuration was established by a NOESY experiment, 
where crosspeaks between H-8/H-10, and H-10/H
3
-19 indicated a cis - 
decalin ring system ( Fig. 5 B). NOESY contacts between H
3
-20/H-2 
indicated an α -orientation of the OH-group at C-2. Diterpene 17 was 
thus a cis -clerodane. 
The absolute configuration of 17 was determined as

(2 R ,5 R ,8 S ,9 R ,10 S ,13 * ) by comparison of experimental and calculated 
ECD spectra ( Fig. 5 C). Due to the absence of chromophores in the vi -
cinity of C-13, the absolute configuration at this position could not be 
established. Taken together, 17 was an ent -neo-clerodane [42] , namely 
(2 R ,5 R ,8 S ,9 R ,10 S ,13 * )-2-hydroxy-clerod-3-en-18-al-15-oic acid. The 
planar structure of 17 surprisingly appears in a chemical catalogue, even 
though the compound cannot be found in the literature. 
Compound 18 was analyzed by HRESIMS and NMR for C
15
H
26
O
3
, a 
molecular formula requiring three degrees of unsaturation. In the 
1
H 
NMR spectrum, the presence of two methyl groups (singlets, δ
H 
1.05, 
1.06), one methylene ( δ
H 
1.47/1.80) indicative of a cyclobutane, and 
one exomethylene group ( δ
H 
4.72 and 4.79) were characteristic for a 
caryophyllene type sesquiterpene. However, the presence of a carboxyl 
group ( δ
C 
178.0) and an unsaturation number of three indicated an 
opening of the macrocycle. Complete NMR spectral assignments by 1D 
and 2D NMR data identified 18 as 4-hydroxy-4,5-seco-caryophyllen-5- 
oic acid, in accord with published data [43] . The relative configura -
tion was determined by a NOESY experiment. Key crosspeaks were 
observed between H
3
-12/H-10a, H-1/H
3
-12, H-9/H
2
-2, H-9/H-10b, and 
H-10b/H
3
-13 ( Fig. 6 A). Thus, H-1 and H-9 were on opposite faces of the 
cyclobutene ring. The absolute configuration of 18 was established as 
(1 R ,4*,9 S )-4-hydroxy-4,5-seco-caryophyllen-5-oic acid by comparison 
of experimental and calculated ECD spectra ( Fig. 6 B). This was in accord 
with the absolute configurations of (-)- β -caryophyllene and its de -
rivatives [44] . The absolute configuration at C-4 could not be estab -
lished due to the lack of a suitable chromophore in the vicinity. 
Labdane-type diterpenes and sesquiterpenes have been previously 
reported in E. nauseosa [40] , but 17 is the first clerodane diterpene 
identified in this genus. 
3.2. Inhibition of AKT and ERK activity 
Compounds 1 - 18 were tested at eight different concentrations 
(200 – 1.56 µ M) by using the HCS assay enabling the simultaneous 
readout of ERK and AKT activities [10] . To analyze the activity of 
structurally diverse flavonoids, the set of isolated compounds was 
enhanced with the commercially available flavonoid aglycons apigenin, 
luteolin, kaempferol and quercetin, the methoxylated flavanone hes -
peretin as well as the flavonoid glycoside isoquercetrin. 
Compounds were first tested on MM121224 cells. As expected, some 
compounds clearly inhibited the AKT pathway. Compounds 3 – 9 , as well 
as luteolin and quercetin inhibited AKT activity with IC
50 
values 
< 60 µ M ( Table 1 ). Compound 9 was the most active (IC
50 
14.7 
± 1.4 µ M; Fig. 7 ), while 1 , 10 , 12 , as well as apigenin, kaempferol and 
hesperetin showed weak inhibition of AKT at 200 µ M. The other flavo -
noids ( 2 , 11 , 13 - 15 and isoquercetrin) as well as terpenes 16 - 18 were 
inactive at all test concentrations. In contrast, none of the compounds 
downregulated ERK activity. 
All compounds were also tested in the well-established A2058 
human melanoma cell line ( Figs. S7-S10 , Supporting Information ). The 
activity observed was generally lower in A2058 than in MM121224 
cells. Compounds 4 – 6 , 8 and luteolin showed a marked inhibition at 
200 µ M, but no IC
50 
values could be determined. Flavonoids 7 , 9 and 
quercetin weakly inhibited AKT activity at the highest test concentra -
tion, whereas the other compounds were inactive ( Figs. S7 -10, Sup -
porting Information ). 
To confirm the results obtained with the KTR-based assays, immu -
nostaining experiments were performed in MM121224 cells with anti 
phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT (serine 473) antibodies. Compounds 4 
and 8 were used in this experiment, and measurements of pERK and 
pAKT (S473) provided similar trends than the ERK/AKT-KTR readouts. 
pAKT was lowered in a concentration-dependent manner, and pERK was 
slightly increased ( Fig. S11 , Supporting Information ). This striking 
behavior of AKT inhibition and slight ERK activation could emerge, 
because AKT inhibition might affect a crosstalk with ERK, or because 4 
and 8 affect other kinases, which in turn could lead to a slight ERK 
activation via negative regulation of phosphatases [45] . 
With a set of structurally diverse flavonoids at hand, some pre -
liminary structure-activity information could be derived from the data. 
First, flavones were more active than flavanones. Furthermore, flavones 
with two substituents on the ring B seemed to be more potent inhibitors 
of the AKT activity than flavones with one or no substituents. Interest -
ingly, the flavonol glycoside isoquercetin was inactive, as compared to 
the active aglycone quercetine. However, additional flavonoids glyco -
sides should be tested to corroborate this observation. 
Given that the assay readout is measuring the activity downstream of 
the signaling cascades, the specific targets of the flavonoids remain to be 
identified. Also, the compounds might target several proteins in the 
network, and may show differing patterns of inhibition on these 
proteins. 
3.3. Physicochemical and ADME properties 
Physiochemical and ADME properties as defined by Lipinski and 
Veber rules [46,47] , were calculated for all compounds, as a preliminary 
assessment of their drug-likeness ( Table S7 ). Values for compounds 1 - 18 
were all in accordance with Lipinski's rule of five, with clog P values

calculated spectrum + 15 nm) of compound 18.

between 0.87 and 4.21, a molecular weight ranging from 254 to 
330 g/mol, with two to four H donor and three to eight H acceptor sites, 
one to eight rotatable bonds, and one to three rings. Predicted solubility 
ranged from 0.33 mg/mL (soluble) to 0.03 mg/mL (highly insoluble), 
and Caco-2 permeability from 111 × 10
6 
cm/s (highly permeable) to 
4.6 × 10
6 
cm/s (moderately permeable). The predicted plasma protein 
binding (PPB) of compounds was moderate to extensive (70 – 96%). 
Compounds 15 and 17 were predicted to be permeable into the CNS, 
whereas the others were either weekly or non-penetrating. Human in -
testinal absorption (HIA) for all compounds was predicted as 100%. 
Taken together, the isoprenoids had the best overall ADME proper -
ties when considering solubility, permeability and plasma protein 
binding. The most active flavonoid 9 showed high predicted perme -
ability in Caco-2 and intestinal absorption, but had a very low calculated 
solubility, extensive plasma protein binding, and no CNS penetration. 
4. Conclusion 
The HPLC-based activity profiling approach was used to localize 
compounds present in the active time window of the DCM extract of 
Ericameria nauseosa. The activity profile guided the scale-up isolation 
and afforded 18 compounds with different natural product scaffolds, 
including 11 flavones ( 1 - 11 ), four flavanones ( 12 - 15 ), a labdane diter -
pene ( 16 ), a clerodane diterpene ( 17 ), and a seco-caryophyllene ( 18 ). 
Flavonoids were found to be responsible for the inhibition of AKT ac -
tivity of the extract, while none of the terpenes was active. Nevertheless, 
to our knowledge the two diterpenes are new natural products and were 
identified as (2 S ,5 S ,9 R ,10 S ,13 S )-2-hydroxygrindelic acid ( 16 ) and 
(2 R ,5 R ,8 S ,9 R ,10 S ,13 * )-2-hydroxy-clerod-3-en-18-al-15-oic acid ( 17 ). 
Interestingly, 17 constitutes the first report of a clerodane type diterpene 
in the genus Ericameria . We also established the absolute configuration 
of (1 R ,4 * ,9 S )-4-hydroxy-4,5-seco-caryophyllen-5-oic acid ( 18 ) and 
found it to be consistent with its likely biosynthetic precursor 
(-)- β -caryophyllene [44] . 
The methoxylated flavone 9 was the most potent compound, with an 
IC
50 
value of 14.7 ± 1.4 µ M. This is the first report of the activity of 9 as 
an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additional experiments are now 
planned to determine the target protein(s) for that compound. Other 
methoxylated flavonoids 3 - 8, as well as quercetin and luteolin were also 
considered as active on the AKT pathway (IC
50 
values between 20 and 
55 µ M). Similar results were obtained in a recent metabolomic study 
[48] . The diverse set of flavonoids isolated in the present investigation 
enabled a preliminary analysis of structure-activity relationship. Fla -
vones were shown to be more active than flavanones. In addition, the 
presence of two substituents on the ring B seemed to have a positive 
effect on the potency. 
Activity of flavonoids on the PI3K/AKT pathway has been already 
reported [49 – 55] , such as for quercetin and luteolin tested in our study 
[49 – 54] . Interestingly, in a docking study, luteolin was shown to 
interact with PI3K in a binding pose similar to that of the 
ATP-competitive inhibitor LY294002 [55] , a synthetic flavonoid analog 
[56] . Moreover, the flavonoid alkaloid analog alvocidib is an inhibitor of 
cycline dependent kinases that has been shown to have promising 
anti-cancer activity [57 – 59] . A prodrug of alvocidib is currently in 
clinical trial for the treatment advanced solid tumors. These examples 
illustrate the potential of flavonoids as promising scaffolds for the 
development of new anticancer drugs [60,61] .
