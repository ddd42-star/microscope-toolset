Brain development and spinal cord regeneration require neu-
rite sprouting and growth cone navigation in response to exten-
sion and collapsing factors present in the extracellular environ-
ment. These external guidance cues control neurite growth cone
extension and retraction processes through intracellular pro-
tein phosphorylation of numerous cytoskeletal, adhesion, and
polarity complex signaling proteins. However, the complex
kinase/substrate signaling networks that mediate neuritogen-
esis have not been investigated. Here, we compare the neurite
phosphoproteome under growth and retraction conditions
using neurite purification methodology combined with mass
spectrometry. More than 4000 non-redundant phosphorylation
sites from 1883 proteins have been annotated and mapped to
signaling pathways that control kinase/phosphatase networks,
cytoskeleton remodeling, and axon/dendrite specification.
Comprehensive informatics and functional studies revealed a
compartmentalized ERK activation/deactivation cytoskeletal
switch that governs neurite growth and retraction, respectively.
Our findings provide the first system-wide analysis of the phos-
phoprotein signaling networks that enable neurite growth and
retraction and reveal an important molecular switch that gov-
erns neuritogenesis.
Neuritogenesis is a dynamic process involving the extension
of long, thin protrusions called neurites that will subsequently
differentiate into long axons or an elaborate dendritic arbor
(1–4). This highly polarized process occurs through the seg-
mentation from the soma periphery of a microtubule-rich shaft
capped with a growth cone, which itself is characterized by an
actin-rich lamellipodium with numerous filopodial extensions
and integrin-mediated adhesive contacts. Understanding this
process is crucial, as it is necessary for proper wiring of the brain
and nerve regeneration and has been linked to numerous neu-
rodegenerative diseases.
Although cultured neurons randomly form neuritesin vitro,
in vivothis process is orchestrated by gradients of chemoattrac-
tants, extracellular matrix proteins, and collapsing factors that
precisely guide neurite initiation and advancement (5, 6). This
occurs in a polarized and highly controlled manner and relies
on spatially regulated mechanisms for gradient sensing, mem-
brane trafficking, integrin-mediated adhesion, and organiza-
tion of the actin-microtubule cytoskeleton (5–8). These events
are largely orchestrated by numerous surface guidance/repul-
sion and adhesion receptors that signal to the cell interior
through multiple kinase activation and substrate phosphoryla-
tion events (7, 9–17). Protein phosphorylation is a critical post-
translational modification that regulates protein-protein inter-
actions, enzymatic activity, and subcellular localization. The
reversible addition of PO4
3/H11002to serine, threonine, and tyrosine
amino acid residues is mediated by more than 500 kinases and
more than 150 phosphatases (18–20). In many cases, kinases
phosphorylate specific amino acids in the context of a consen-
sus recognition sequence. For example, ERK is a proline-di-
rected kinase that phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues with the
consensus sequence PX(S/T)P, whereX can be a neutral or
basic amino acid (21–24). The identification of phosphoryla-
tion sites in the context of a specific kinase recognition
sequence of given substrates has proven quite useful in the
predication of kinase activation events in the cell (25–27). Also,
kinases themselves can be phosphorylated at specific sites that
are known to promote enzymatic activation, which can be used
to predict kinase activity in the cell. This is further enriched by
computational models that predict higher order contextual fea-
tures of kinases such as protein scaffolding, subcellular localiza-
tion, and expression patterns (13, 25–28). When combined,in
silico programs have been shown to predict kinase activity with
significant accuracy. This approach has been applied to large
phosphoproteomic data sets consisting of thousands of phos-
phorylation sites revealing important kinase signaling networks

(13, 25, 29, 30).
Although significant progress has been made in identifying
specific signals regulating neuritogenesis, a system-wide analy-
sis of the phosphoprotein signals that control this process has
not been investigated. Consequently, our understanding of the
complex kinase/substrate signaling networks that regulate neu-
rite formation and guidance is not defined. Here we describe a
microporous filter method that facilitates selective purification
of neurites undergoing growth or retraction. This fractionation
method combined with immobilized metal-ion affinity chro-
matography and LC-MS protein identification technologies
facilitated the identification of thousands of protein phosphor-
ylation signatures that mediate neurite extension or retraction
events induced by growth promoting or collapsing stimuli,
respectively. Functional annotation and kinase activity predica-
tionsin silico revealed phosphoprotein networks controlling
cytoskeletal remodeling, axon/dendrite specification, and cell
adhesion.Kinase signaling analysis and cell-based assays
revealed that an integrin/MEK/ERK signaling pathway oper-
ates as a critical switch controlling neurite extension and
retraction dynamics.

Purification of Growing and Retracting Neurites—Proce-
dures for the culturing and biochemical preparation of extend-
ing neurites from NIE-115 cells using 3.0-/H9262m microporous fil-
ters were the same as described before (35). To purify retracting
neurites, NIE-115 cells were allowed to extend neurites for var-
ious times (8–24 h) toward laminin (10/H9262g/ml, Millipore), then
LPA (1/H9262M) was added to the media in either the upper or lower
chamber to induce retraction for the times indicated in the text.
Extending or retracting neurites or their corresponding cell
bodies were differentially harvested into lysis buffer for bio-
chemical analyses as described (35). For GTPase activity assays,
lysates were prepared as previously described (35). To block
LPA-induced neurite retraction 10/H9262M Y-27632 was added to
the chamber for 60 min before LPA stimulation. To block ERK
activation, 25/H9262M PD98059 was added to the chamber for
the indicated times. Transient transfection of NIE-115 with the
plasmids, neurite imaging, and immunofluorescence of the
neurite cytoskeleton was performed as described (35). To pre-
pare samples for proteomics analysis, extending or retracting
neurites or their corresponding cell bodies were differentially
harvested into lysis buffer of freshly made 7M urea, 0.5% Non-
idet P-40 in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) containing
50 nM calyculin A and 0.2 mM vanadate as phosphatase inhibi-
tors. After incubation on ice for 30 min, insoluble matter was
removed by centrifugation at 16,000/H11003g for 20 min.
Phosphopeptide Enrichment and Capillary HPLC-MS/MS
Analysis—Protein samples (five biological replicates each for
both extending and retracting neurites) were digested with
trypsin at room temperature. Tryptic peptides were desalted
and methyl-esterified (250/H9262g for each sample) followed by
immobilized metal-ion (Fe3/H11001) affinity chromatography to en-
rich phosphopeptides, as detailed in a recent report (36). After
immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography enrichment,
aliquots (one-sixth of the immobilized metal-ion affinity chro-
matography elution) were analyzed on a ThermoElectron
LTQ-Orbitrap (Waltham, MA) coupled to an automated dual-
column phosphoproteome nano-HPLC platform assembled in-
house. The LC gradient (A/H11005100 mM HOAc in H2O, B /H1100570%
acetonitrile, 100 mM HOAc in H2O) was 0–70% B for/H11011180
min. For each sample, two technical replicates of LC-MS anal-
yses were performed (36).
Data Base Search and Peptide Identification—Phosphopep-
tides were identified from MS/MS spectra using SEQUEST by
searching against the mouse IPI data base. For confident phos-
phopeptide identifications, the false discovery rate at peptide
spectrum level was controlled at/H113490.5% using in-house devel-
oped software (37). This program also measured the probability
of correct phosphorylation site localization in each identified
peptide by calculating the AScore for each phosphorylation site
(38), and the assigned top phosphopeptide sequence was taken
as the final peptide identification for a given spectrum.
Evaluation of Phosphopeptide Changes in Growth and
Retracting Neurite—We applied the spectral count method to
evaluate the changes of phosphopeptides. The total spectral
counts for each identified phosphopeptide in each neurite con-
dition and their ratios were used to semi-quantitatively esti-
mate their abundance in each condition (39).
Bioinformatics—The pathway analysis was performed using
the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems) as
previously described (48). Briefly, we queried all phosphopro-
teins against the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge base to search
all possible pathways that could be represented by the query
proteins. The significance of each pathway was evaluated by the
right-tailed Fisher’s Exact test, which measures how likely it is
the query proteins are relevant to the pathway. For the kinase

RESULTS
Model System for Purification of Growing and Retracting
Neurites—Our previous work has shown that extending neu-
rites can be purified from the cell body of NIE-115 cells using
culture chambers equipped with 3.0-/H9262m microporous filters
(Fig. 1A) (35). We utilized these NIE-115 cells because they can
be grown in large numbers for large-scale biochemical analysis
and have been well characterized for their neuron-like proper-
ties. Laminin was coated on the bottom of the filter, which
serves as a potent and directional cue for neurite initiation (35,
40–42). Neurite extension through the pore to the lower sur-
face of the filter is/H92521-integrin-dependent and occurs in a highly
directional and polarized manner (35). Therefore, because the
cell body remains on the surface of the filter and neurite growth
occurs exclusively through the pore to the lower surface, it is
possible to selectively purify this structure from the polarized
neuron for spatial proteomic analysis. Neurite growth under
these conditions is linear for up to 24 h, reaching a maximum
around 36–48 h after plating (Fig. 1,A–C). The optimal time to
harvest extending neurites for biochemical analyses was 18–20

h post-plating on the laminin-coated filters. At this time the
majority of neurites are elongating, have well defined growth
cones, and provide sufficient amount of neurite protein for MS
analysis. To obtain retracting neurites, we added the collapsing
factor, LPA, to the lower chamber containing neurites that had
been allowed to extend to the lower surface for 18 h (43–45).
The kinetics of retraction was shown in Fig. 1D. Retracting
neurites were harvested 10–15 min after LPA stimulation
because the majority of neurites were in the process of retrac-
tion and sufficient amounts of neurite protein can still be
obtained from the filter at this time. It is notable that applying
LPA selectively to the cell bodies on the upper chamber surface
did not significantly induce neurite retraction. These findings
indicate that the neurite and soma compartments of polarized
neurons are spatially sensitive to this collapsing agent through
an unknown mechanism. The spatial sensitivity to guidance
cues like LPA is indicative of highly polarized neurons (5–7, 17,
46–51). Also, the neurite purification system is amenable to
other cells and ECM proteins including pheochromocytoma
PC12 cells on fibronectin and laminin (35). These findings
together with our previous work indicate that the microporous
system provides a robust method to selectively purify growing
or retracting neurites.
Comparison of the Neurite Phosphoproteomes from Growing
and Retracting Neurites—The ability to selectively purify grow-
ing or retracting neurites independent of the soma provided a
unique opportunity to study the phosphorylation/dephosphor-
ylation mechanisms and kinase networks governing neurito-
genesis in a highly spatial manner. To quantify relative changes
in specific phosphorylation sites in purified growing and
retracting neurites, we used immobilized metal-ion affinity
chromatography to capture phosphopeptides and a liquid chro-
matography-mass spectrometry platform to identify parent
proteins and their sites of phosphorylation as described under
“Experimental Procedures” (52–56). In total, 3512 phospho-
peptides were identified by MS/MS from growing and retract-
ing neurites, representing 1883 phosphoproteins and 4145
non-redundant phosphorylation sites (supplemental Table 1).
Of these peptides, 2676 were singly phosphorylated, and 836
were doubly or multiply phosphorylated. The protein identifi-
cations and sites of phosphorylation were confidently assigned
with an false discovery rate of 1%.
A change in a specific phosphorylation site(s) within a phos-
phopeptide was considered significant with a total spectral
count of 2 or more and if it either increased or decreased by at
least 1.5-fold or was uniquely identified in the growing or
retracting neurite fraction. All other phosphorylation sites were
considered equally abundant with no specific change in both
conditions. Before evaluating the relative abundance of a spe-
cific phosphopeptide in growing or retracting neurites, we first
filtered the phosphopeptide dataset to remove redundancy
because some peptides from the same protein may contain
exactly the same phosphorylation sites due to miscleavage dur-
ing tryptic digestion. After removing the redundancy, we
obtained a total of 3203 phosphopeptides with unique phos-
phorylation status,i.e. even two peptides with the same amino
acid sequences from the same protein must have different
phosphorylation sites. The growth to retraction ratios of all
phosphorylation sites are shown in supplemental Table 1.
Using these criteria, 513 phosphopeptides were increased in
growing neurites, 368 phosphopeptides were increased in
retracting neurites, and 543 phosphopeptides were equally
abundant. In total, 531 proteins were observed to have altered
phosphorylation sites (/H110221.5 or/H110210.67) in response to neurite
extension and retraction.
Functional Annotation of Phosphoproteins Involved in Neu-
rite Growth and Retraction—To find the functional interrela-
tionship and assign the identified phosphoproteins that change
during growth and retraction to their signaling pathways, we
used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program and the Ingenu-
ity Pathways Knowledge base. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis is a
system-wide data base of biological pathways created from
multiple relationships of proteins, genes, and diseases. The
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program can analyze large
genomic or proteomic datasets to find the most statistically
significant canonical pathways and protein networks relevant
to the dataset based on the calculated probability score by
searching the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge base. Of a total of
78 pathways identified, RhoA signaling was the most highly
represented during the growth and retraction of the neurite
(Fig. 2,supplemental Fig. 1). This was expected, as RhoA sig-
naling has been shown to play a prominent role in mediating
neurite retraction in response to various collapsing factors
including LPA (17, 44, 45, 57–59). Also, given that the cytoskel-
etal remodeling is a key event during neurite growth and retrac-
tion, it is not surprising that many pathways that regulate the
FIGURE 2.Canonical pathways that are significantly represented by the
identified phosphoproteins.1775 of 1883 identified phosphoproteins were

er’s test. Shown are 28 of the most significant pathways.ILK, Integrin linked

cytoskeleton were highly represented including the small
GTPases Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42 as well as integrin signaling
integrin linked kinase (ILK), and FAK (1, 7, 8, 17, 35, 46, 47,
60–66). Furthermore, it is notable that ERK, PI3K, and PKA
kinase signaling are highly represented as these pathways are
known to control cytoskeleton remodeling (66–74). Interest-
ingly, in our previous work we reported that integrin and cyto-
skeleton-associated proteins were also the most abundant pro-
teins represented in the neurite compared with the soma
compartment (35). Thus, cytoskeletal proteins are highly
enriched in the neurite and are the major targets modified by
phosphorylation during neurite growth and retraction.
Together these findings highlight the significance of using neu-
rite purification methodology and phosphoprotein profiling to
reveal signaling pathways that control neurite growth and
retraction in a highly spatial manner.
Assignment of Identified Phosphorylation Sites to Known
Kinases—To determine the kinases responsible for phosphor-
ylation of neurite proteins, we utilized NetworKIN, an integra-
tive computational approach that greatly augments kinase
motif-based approaches by using contextual information to
enhance kinase-substrate assignments (25, 28). The contextual
information is integrated from curated pathway databases, pro-
tein interaction assays, scaffolding, co-occurrence in abstracts,
physical protein interaction assays, mRNA expression studies,
subcellular localization, and genomic context. Combining the
contextual information with existing matrices that identify
kinase domain recognition motifs has been shown to improve
the accuracy of kinase-substrate assignments by 2.5-fold. Using
this approach, we were able to assign specific kinases to 73.3%
(737 of 1006) of the phosphorylation sites that change during
neurite growth or retraction (Fig. 3). Of the 82 different kinases
assigned to this process, cAMP-dependent protein kinase cat-
alytic subunit/H9251(PKACA), Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK),
mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 5
(MAPKAPK5), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3 or
ERK1), and PDGF receptor/H9252kinases showed the highest ratio
for the number of substrate phosphorylations in the extending
neuriteversus retracting neurites, whereas protein kinase C/H9256
(PRKCZ), cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunit /H9253
(PRKACG), and lymphocyte protein tyrosine kinase (LCK)
showed the lowest ratio.
ERK/MEK and RhoA Signaling Are Spatially Regulated dur-
ing Neurite Growth and Retraction—Our computational anal-
yses indicate that MEK/ERK (MAP2K4) and RhoA signaling are
highly modulated in growing/retracting neurites (Figs. 2 and 3
andsupplemental Fig. 1). Because the role of ERK and RhoA
signaling in controlling neurite dynamics is poorly understood,
we investigated these signaling pathways in more detail (40, 67,
75–81). We first directly monitored MEK and ERK kinase
activities in the soma/neurite fractions using Western blotting
and phosphospecific antibodies that report kinase activities of
these proteins due to phosphorylation of MEK-Ser-218/Ser-
222 and ERK TEY sequence (Fig. 4A). Both ERK and MEK
kinase activities are highly increased in the extending neurite
compared with the soma. The total level of ERK protein was the
same in the soma and neurite compartments, whereas total
MEK protein was slightly increased in the neurite. These find-
ings demonstrate that MEK/ERK activity is highly compart-
mentalized to the neurite during formation of this structure.
Interestingly, LPA-mediated neurite collapse induced a rapid
decrease in ERK and MEK activities, which correlated with neu-
rite retraction kinetics (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, Akt activity
was not inhibited by LPA-induced neurite retraction (Fig. 4C).
These findings demonstrate that in polarized neurons MEK/
ERK kinase activity is highly compartmentalized within the
neurite and that during neurite collapse MEK/ERK activity is
shut off.
Integrins Spatially Regulate MEK Phosphorylation/Activa-
tion during Neurite Growth and Retraction—We next investi-
gated how MEK activity and its known regulators are spatially
organized in growing and retracting neurites to mediate com-
partmentalized ERK activity. Because we previously showed
that/H92521 integrins drive directional neurite extension toward
laminin in this model, we wanted to know if integrins played a
role in MEK/ERK activation (35). During cell adhesion and
membrane spreading, MEK1 activity has been shown to be reg-
ulated by integrin signals that promote phosphorylation of
threonine 292 (Thr-292, human) and serine 298 (Ser-298,
human) (31–34). Integrins activate the small GTPases Rac and
Cdc42, which activate PAK kinase, which in turn phosphory-
lates MEK-Ser-298, leading to increased catalytic activity
toward ERK. Interestingly, current evidence indicates that
phosphorylation of MEK-Thr-292 by ERK itself negatively reg-
ulates MEK activity by decreasing PAK ability to phosphorylate
MEK-Ser-298. This reduces the efficiency of MEK activity
toward ERK, thereby reducing its kinase activity. In this way
ERK-mediated phosphorylation of MEK-Thr-292 serves as a
negative feedback loop for self-regulation. However, the role of
integrin/Rac/Cdc42/PAK to MEK-Thr-292/Ser-298phosphor-
ylation in neurite formation has not been investigated to date.
Interestingly, in the soma we observed low levels of MEK-
Ser-298 phosphorylation that was concomitant with a high
level of MEK-Thr-292 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Conversely,
in the extending neurite, the level of MEK-Thr-292 phosphor-

ylation was decreased relative to the level of MEK Ser-298 phos-
phorylation, which is consistent with the high level of ERK
activity in this compartment (Fig. 4A). The increased ratio of
MEK Thr-292/Ser-298 phosphorylation relative to the small
pool of activated ERK present in the soma indicates that MEK
activity is strongly inhibited in the soma due to the negative
feedback modulation by ERK. These findings are consistent
with the idea that the low level of ERK activity in the soma (Fig.
4A) results from the uncoupling of PAK from MEK-Ser-298
phosphorylation. On the other hand, negative feedback modu-
lation of MEK by ERK in the neurite is significantly attenuated,
leading to robust MEK-Ser-298 phosphorylation and increased
ERK kinase activity. Thus, in the neurite MEK/ERK activity is
robust and strongly coupled to integrin/PAK signaling, whereas
in the soma ERK activity is low and not uncoupled to integrin/
PAK signaling due to strong negative feedback modulation by
ERK. These findings suggest that integrins drive directional
neurite extension through compartmentalized PAK/MEK/
ERK signaling. These findings are further supported by the
observation that Cdc42 and Rac activities are significantly ele-
vated in the neurite compared with the soma (Fig. 4D). We also
detected several PAK family members (1, 2, 4) that are present
in the neurite and modified by phosphorylation (supplemental
Table 1).
LPA-induced Neurite Collapse Disrupts Integrin/PAK/Rac/
Cdc42/MEK/ERK Signaling—In the neurite, the level of Ser-
298 phosphorylation decreased in response to LPA-induced
collapse, which correlated with the loss of ERK, Cdc42, and Rac
activities (Fig. 4,A–D). As expected, MEK-Thr-292 phosphor-
ylation by ERK decreased in response to the loss of ERK activity
(Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that LPA induces neurite col-
lapse and ERK activity by interfering with integrin adhesion
signaling to Rac/Cdc42/PAK and MEK-Ser-298 phosphoryla-
tion. In support of these findings, LPA blocked ERK activation
and MEK Ser-298 phosphorylation induced by integrin-medi-
ated NIE-115 cell attachment and spreading on laminin (Fig.
4G). In addition, LPA wasfound to modulate tyrosinephosphor-
ylation of several known integrin/focal adhesion-associated
proteins (FAK, CAS, Abl, Lasp-1, Crk) (Fig. 4,E and F) (82–85).
It is also notable that LPA treatmentdecreased CAS phosphor-
ylation, whereas it increased Crk Tyr-221 phosphorylation and
Abl/Arg tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4E). These phosphory-
lation events have been previously associated with decreased
CAS/Crk coupling and Rac activity in spreading cells down-
stream of integrin receptors (83–85). Taken together these
findings suggest that neurite extension involves integrin activa-
tion of the CAS/Crk/Rac/Cdc42/PAK/MEK-Ser-298/ERK sig-
naling pathway, whereas LPA-induced collapse blocks activa-
tion of integrin signaling leading to neurite detachment and
retraction from the substrate.
Integrin Regulation of MEK/ERK Activity Is Necessary for
Neurite Growth and Retraction—To investigate the functional
significance of MEK/ERK activity in neuritogenesis, we ex-
pressed mutationally activated MEK (MEK-S211E/S222E, cat-
alytically active MEK, MEK-CA) in cells and then examined
neurite formation toward laminin (Fig. 5,A and D). This phos-
phomimetic mutation promoted constitutive ERK activation
and increased neurite formation (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, substi-
tution of Ser-298 with an alanine residue in MEK-CA partially
reduced neurite formation, suggesting that this site of phos-
phorylation does contribute to MEK/ERK-induced neurite for-

mation even when MEK is constitutively activated. In contrast,
MEK-CA with Thr-292 mutated to alanine increased neurite
formation probably because MEK is no longer susceptible to
negative feedback regulation by ERK (Fig. 5A). MEK kinase
activity was required for neurite formation, as treatment of cells
with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK activation and
neurite formation on laminin (Fig. 5B). These findings indicate
that MEK activation is sufficient and necessary to induce neu-
rite formation, and this response is partially regulated by MEK-
Ser-298/Thr-292 phosphorylation.
Inhibition of MEK/ERK Activity Is Necessary for RhoA/
ROCK/MLC-mediated Neurite Retraction—We next investi-
gated whether MEK/ERK inactivation is required for neurite
retraction. NIE-115 cells expressing a mutationally active form
of MEK1 (MEK-CA) were treated with LPA and monitored for
neurite retraction and ERK kinase inactivation. Strikingly, LPA
did not induce neurite retraction or inhibit ERK activation in
MEK-CA cells nor did it prevent Ser-298 phosphorylation (Fig.
5, C and D). The fact that phosphorylation of MEK-Ser-298 is
not inhibited by LPA treatment in MEK-CA cells suggests that
ERK activation provides a positive feedback mechanism to
maintain integrin/Rac/Cdc42/PAK signaling in the neurite,
thereby preventing neurite detachment and retraction from the
ECM. Interestingly, although inhibition of MEK/ERK activity
with PD98059 did not induce neurite retraction by itself, it did
increase retraction induced by a suboptimal dose of LPA (50%
of the maximum) (Fig. 5E). Thus, although the loss of ERK
activity is not sufficient to induce neurite retractionper se,i t
does sensitize the cell to LPA-mediated retraction. These find-
ings suggest that LPA-induced neurite retraction not only
requires ERK deactivation but also involves activation/deacti-
vation of additional signaling pathways. RhoA activation is a
likely candidate as LPA-induced neurite retraction requires
RhoA activation, which facilitates ROCK-mediated myosin
contraction (supplemental Fig. 1) (7, 17, 57, 86–88). Consistent
with these observations, the ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632

prevented neurite retraction and myosin contraction as indi-
cated by a decrease in serine 19 phosphorylation of myosin light
chain (Fig. 6,A and B) (7, 88). Importantly, Y-27632 not only
prevented neurite retraction but also blocked LPA-induced
ERK deactivation and MEK-Ser-298 phosphorylation in the
neurite fraction (Fig. 6B). Thus, inhibition of integrin/Rac-
Cdc42/PAK/MEK/ERK signaling is necessary for LPA-RhoA/
ROCK/MLC-mediated neurite retraction. Based on our func-
tional proteomics work and the work of others we proposed a
model for how neurites extend and retract in response to
laminin and LPA. The model is shown schematically in Fig. 6C
andsupplemental Fig. 1and is discussed below.
DISCUSSION
Our ability to differentially isolate neurites in a state of
growth or retraction for proteomic analyses provided a simple
and robust system to globally profile thousands of protein phos-
phorylation and kinase changes that mediate neuritogenesis.
An important aspect of this model system is the ability to spe-
cifically isolate the neurite from the soma for proteomic analy-
ses. This unique strategy allowed us to mine deeper into the
neurite phosphoproteome, uncovering many more low abun-
dant phosphoproteins. Because of this, we were able to obtain a
more precise picture of the complex spatial kinase/substrate
networks that control neurite growth/retraction kinetics. Also,
the neurite purification methods described here will likely
transfer to other neuronal cell types, guidance factors, and col-
lapsing agents. For example, we have previously reported that
neurites can be readily purified from PC12 cells responding to
laminin and fibronectin guidance cues (35). It may also be pos-
sible to selectively purify axons and dendrites from primary
neurons for detailed proteomic analyses using specific differen-
tiation and/or guidance factors. In any case, the utility of this
model system combined with the rapid progress being made in

quantitative mass spectrometry will help provide a more com-
prehensive understanding of the neurite proteome and its spa-
tial organization, which in turn will provide valuable insight
into the various disease pathologies caused by deregulation of
this process.
Using NetworKIN, we find that a large panel of kinases is
active during neurite growth, whereas a relatively reduced
number of kinases are active during retraction. Many of these
kinases have been previously implicated in the regulation of
different aspects of neurite outgrowth. PKA (PKACA) can trig-
ger neurite outgrowth by phosphorylating synapsins (89) and
CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) (90). The
MET receptor (MET) enhances axonal outgrowth of cultured
dorsal root ganglions by potentiating NGF signaling (91). The
tyrosine kinase BTK (BTK) phosphorylates the actin regulator
N-WASP, which is essential for neurite outgrowth (92). The
cyclin kinase Cdk5 (CDK5) regulates neurite and axon out-
growth by phosphorylating the kinase PAK1 and the microtu-
bule-associated proteinMAP1B (93). GSK3 (GSK3A) phosphor-
ylates the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp-2) to
promote neurite elongation via microtubule assembly (94). The
MAP kinase kinase MKK4 (MAP2K4) and its substrate JNK
(MAPK9) have also been involved in the regulation of neurite
outgrowth through the phosphorylation of the microtubule
binding proteins MAP, MAP1, doublecortin, and SGC10 (95).
Although these findings point to a wide array of kinase classes
that regulate neuritogenesis, it is likely that they work together
in time and space to fine-tune changes in the actin and micro-
tubule cytoskeletons that drive this process. Using similar pro-
teomics and bioinformatic methods, we recently revealed a Rho
GTPase signaling network that regulates neurite outgrowth
(35). This allowed us to uncover an unexpected signaling com-
plexity, with different Rho GTPase signaling modules operating
in time and space to regulate distinct neurite functions includ-
ing neurite initiation, elongation, pathfinding, and filopodial
stabilization. Similarly, the wide kinase activation and signal
annotation profiles we observes hint to a high degree of modu-
larity in fine tuning neuritogenesis. On the other hand, the
precise functions of the protein kinases that modulate LPA-
induced neurite collapse were less clear from our phosphopro-
teomic datasets. However, one of these kinases, serum- and
glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, regulates microtubule depo-
lymerization and the shortening of neuronal processes (96). It
will be important in the future to systematically probe these
different kinase-substrate networks to reveal their specialized
contribution to the dynamic processes of neurite growth and
retraction.
Our combined informatics and functional studies revealed
that integrin to MEK/ERK signaling plays a prominent role in
controlling neuritogenesis. Based on our findings and the work
of others, we have constructed a working model for how MEK/
ERK activation and deactivation by LPA control neuritogenesis
(Fig. 6C). The signaling components that were used to con-
struct the schematic and their relative abundance in the soma
and neurite as well as their observed phosphorylation sites are
listed in Fig. 6Cand supplemental Table 3. Fig. 6Cpanel a
shows the proposed pathway for how integrins mediate ERK
activation leading to neurite extension. ECM proteins like
laminin and fibronectin are present as adhesive gradients in the
extracellular environment that can initiate and guide neurite
protrusion from the cell body through activation of integrin
receptors and the recruitment of their downstream effectors
including FAK/CAS/Crk (8, 83, 84). This canonical pathway
operates spatially in the neurite to drive localized Rac activation
of PAK. PAK then phosphorylates MEK Ser-298, leading to
enhanced MEK and ERK activity as described in non-neuronal
cells (31–34). The integrin/Rac/PAK/MEK-Ser-298 signaling
cascade promotes strong sustained ERK activation, which
serves as a switch to mediate neurite outgrowth while suppress-
ing basal RhoA/ROCK/MLC-mediated membrane contractil-
ity, possibly through PKA activation (panel b).
Although the spatial mechanisms that promote localized
ERK activation in the neurite are not clear, the integrin/Rac/
PAK activation pathway most likely works in close conjunction
with common upstream activators of MEK including Rap-1,
Ras, and Raf (22, 97–102). These upstream signals fully activate
MEK through phosphorylation of Ser-218/Ser-222 (103, 104).
It is notable that although MEK activation may occur through
either B-Raf and/or Raf-1 activation, our phosphoproteomics
work suggests that B-Raf is more likely involved as Raf-1 is
highly phosphorylated on Ser-43 (growth specific) in extending
neurites (supplemental Table 1). Ser-43 phosphorylation has
previously been associated with PKA activation and is inhibi-
tory to Raf-1 kinase activity (105, 106). How then is B-Raf activ-
ity modulated to increase MEK/ERK signaling? Integrin activa-
tion of Rap-1 can modulate B-Raf activity, as can cAMP/PKA
signaling (102). Rap1A and -B isoforms are present in the neu-
rite, and several Rap1 GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange fac-
tor) and GAP (GTPase-activating protein) effector proteins are
differentially phosphorylated during neurite growth and retrac-
tion (supplemental Table 1). Rap activity and its effectors could
be modulated directly or indirectly by integrin activation
and/or cell spreading on laminin, possibly through PKA activa-
tion (102). Alternatively, integrin activation of FAK/Src can
facilitate activation of the canonical Grb2 (growth factor rec-
tor-bound protein 2)/SOS (son of sevenless)/Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway (22). In the end, ERK activity self-regulates by
modulation of its upstream activators through negative feed-
back phosphorylation of MEK-S292, which suppresses PAK
phosphorylation of 298 and phosphorylation of B-Raf-Ser-151,
which inhibits B-Raf activity (102). Fig. 6C panel cshows a list of
cytoskeletal effector proteins that are either known and/or pre-
dicted to be phosphorylated by ERK and, thus, may modulate
neurite growth. Of particular interest are/H9251-parvin, which mod-
ulates focal adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the
microtubule modulating proteins Crmp-1, MARK2 (microtu-
bule-associated regulatory kinase 2), MAP1B, and MAP2 (10,
107–109).Supplemental Table 2shows a complete list of all
identified phosphoproteins with ERK consensus phosphoryla-
tion signatures.
An important finding in our study was that LPA could dis-
rupt integrin signaling, leading to blockade of the CAS/Crk/
Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK pathway (Fig. 6C,panels aand b). We sus-
pect that this facilitates neurite detachment from the ECM by
losing integrin adhesions to the substratum while activating the
Rho/ROCK contractile mechanisms that physically mediate

growth cone collapse and membrane retraction through force
generation (Fig. 6Cand supplemental Fig. 1) (7). Interestingly,
the RhoA/ROCK/MLC pathway has been reported to mediate
neurite collapse by modulating Crmp family proteins and
microtubule dynamics (5, 108–110). In our work here, Crmp-1
was observed to be enriched by 7-fold in the neurite and to be
differentially phosphorylated on multiple sites in neurites
undergoing growth or retraction (supplemental Table 1). Al-
though the mechanisms that block LPA-induced integrin sig-
naling in the neurite are not defined, Abl family kinases (Abl
and Arg) are likely to play a central role through their ability to
modulate CAS/Crk coupling and Rac activity at adhesion sites
as described (8, 83–85, 111–113). Importantly, we found that
Abl is hypertyrosine-phosphorylated and enriched by 7-fold in
the neurite. Also, Abl itself and its known substrates c-CrkII
Tyr-221 and LASP-1 show increased phosphorylation in the
neurite in response to LPA (Fig. 4E) (82). This suggests that
LPA activates Abl kinase, which in turn tyrosine phosphory-
lates Crk at Tyr-221, inhibiting CAS/Crk coupling and down-
stream Rac/PAK/MEK activation. It is also notable that LPA
did not inhibit MEK-Ser-298 phosphorylation by PAK in cells
expressing constitutively activated MEK, which was associated
with decreased neurite retraction (Fig. 5,A and D). This sug-
gests that MEK/ERK signaling provides a positive feedback to
maintain integrin/CAS/Crk/Rac/PAK signaling and, thus, pre-
vents neurite retraction.
Taken together our work and the work of others suggest a
model whereby the net effect of high Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK acti-
vation and RhoA inhibition is increased membrane protrusion
and decreased neurite contraction events leading to net neurite
growth. Increased Rac activity has been shown to suppress
RhoA signaling, which leads to neurite growth in neurons (7,
114). PKA and ERK signaling can also suppress RhoA signaling
in other cell types (115–117). On the other hand, LPA strongly
activates RhoA/ROCK/MLC and Abl kinase, which together
mediate neurite detachment from the ECM and membrane
contraction, leading to growth cone turning and/or collapse. In
this model Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK signaling serves as a spatially
compartmentalized switch that operates downstream of integ-
rin and LPA receptor activation to modulate neurite growth
and retraction kinetics, respectively. Our findings provide a
plausible mechanism for how neuronal growth cones spatially
interpret extracellular cues and navigate through complex tis-
sues, which is critical for proper brain development and spinal
cord regeneration.
