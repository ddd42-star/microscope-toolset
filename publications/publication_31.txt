Hypervirulent Clostridium difficile strains, which are associated
with increased morbidity and mortality, produce the actin-ADP
ribosylating toxinClostridium difficiletransferase (CDT). CDT depoly-
merizes actin, causes formation of microtubule-based protrusions,
and increases pathogen adherence. Here, we show that septins (SEPT)
are essential for CDT-induced protrusion formation. SEPT2, -6, -7, and
-9 accumulate at predetermined protrusion sites and form collar-like
structures at the base of protrusions. The septin inhibitor forchlorfe-
nuron or knockdown of septins inhibits protrusion formation. At
protrusion sites, septins colocalize with the GTPase Cdc42 (cell divi-
sion control protein 42) and its effector Borg (binder of Rho GTPases),
which act as up-stream regulators ofseptin polymerization. Precipi-
tation and surface plasmon resonance studies revealed high-affinity
binding of septins to the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1,
thereby guiding incoming microtubules. The data suggest that CDT
usurps conserved regulatory principles involved in microtubule–mem-
brane interaction, depending on septins, Cdc42, Borgs, and restructur-
ing of the actin cytoskeleton.

T
he pathogen Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of
pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea
(1). Recently emerging hypervirulent strains (e.g., NAP1/027)
have been associated with severe courses ofC. difficileinfections
with increased morbidity and mortality (2). These strains have
deletions in regulatory genes, resulting in overexpression of the
Rho-inactivating glycosylating toxins A and B (3). Additionally,
they produce the binary toxinC. difficile transferase (CDT) (2,
4). CDT ADP ribosylates actin at arginine-177, thereby inhibit-
ing actin polymerization (5–7).
CDT-induced depolymerization of F-actin induces formation
of long microtubule-based protrusions, which form a meshwork on
the surface of intestinal host cells (8). Clostridia are enwrapped by
the protrusions, resulting in increased pathogen adherence. In
addition to microtubules, the protrusions contain membrane
tubules of endoplasmic reticulum and allow traffic of Rab5- and
Rab11-positive vesicles (9). Moreover, CDT induces rerouting of
fibronectin-containing vesicles from the basolateral to the apical
side of intestinal epithelial cells. Here, fibronectin, a binding
protein forClostridium difficile, is released at microtubule-based
protrusions, suggesting that the cell-surface extensions partici-
pate in host–pathogen interaction (9).
Protrusion formation occurs in membrane areas where CDT
causes partial depolymerization of cortical actin (8). The toxin
induces the redistribution of microtubule capture proteins such
as Clasp2 and ACF7, which are normally associated with cortical
actin, from the membrane to the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that
CDT alters the functions of the capture proteins. Also, the choles-
terol content of membranes was found to be crucial for protrusion
formation (10). So far, however, the molecular mechanisms involved
in formation of CDT-induced cell protrusions are largely unknown.
We asked whether septins (SEPT), which interact with both
F-actin and microtubules, are involved in toxin-induced restructur-
ing of the cytoskeleton and formation of protrusions. Septins are
conserved GTP-binding proteins, which form hetero-oligomers
and polymers, and are considered as the fourth component of
the cytoskeleton in addition to microfilaments, microtubules,
and intermediate filaments (11–13). Septins are involved in nu-
merous functions, including cytokinesis, ciliogenesis, neurite de-
velopment, and exocytosis (14–17). They have scaffold functions,
act as membrane diffusion barriers, and are involved in host–
pathogen interactions. Septins locate to cell membranes, where
they control the stiffness/rigidity and the shape of membranes.
Here, we report that formation of CDT-induced protrusions
depends on septins, which are located at the base of the pro-
trusions. Septins are involved in early steps of protrusion for-
mation and guide microtubules from the cytosol into emerging
protrusions at the cell membrane, a process that probably in-
volves the plus-end tracking protein EB1 (end-binding protein
1). Cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) and its effector Borg
(binder of Rho GTPases), which are up-stream regulators of
septins, control CDT-induced protrusion formation (18). The
data indicate that CDT exploits a highly conserved regulatory
pathway of microtubule–membrane interaction.

Significance
The bacterial toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) de-
polymerizes actin and forms microtubule-based cell protru-
sions suggested to be involved in cell adherence of bacteria.
Here we report that GTP-binding septin proteins initiate
protrusion formation. Accumulation of septins at sites of
protrusion initiation depends on the small GTPase Cdc42 (cell
division control protein 42) and its effector Borg (binder of
Rho GTPases). CDT-induced septin accumulations at the cell
membrane guide microtubules to form cell protrusions. Sep-
tins directly interact with the microtubule plus-end tracking
protein EB1. Thus, the toxin exploits septin-dependent regu-
lation of microtubules to form cell protrusions.

microtubule-based membrane protrusions 40–60 min after toxin
addition (Fig. 1A). Protrusion formation was paralleled by partial
destruction of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S1A). Changes in the
actin and microtubule cytoskeleton were accompanied by major
remodeling and relocalization of septins. In untreated cells, sep-
tins were found associated mainly with actin filaments and par-
tially with the microtubule lattice (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1A,a n dFig. S2A
and B). After treatment with CDT, septins originally associated
with cortical actin lost the colocalization during actin depoly-
merization (Fig. S1 A and B). The major fraction of septins de-
veloped structures resembling circles and arches at the base of
CDT-induced protrusion. In some cases, septins also colocalized
along the microtubules within protrusions (Fig. S1A). Notably,
septins appeared at membranes early after CDT addition at sites
of very small protrusions, which had just started to grow. Immu-
nofluorescence studies revealed participation of SEPT2, -6, and
-7 in this process (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2 A and B). In 3D recon-
structions, septins accumulated at the apical surface of cells re-
sembling a collar or arch at the protrusion base (Fig. 1C). These
structures were also observed with polarized Caco-2 cells (Fig. S3
A and B). Here, SEPT9 also was part of septin accumulations (Fig.
S3 C and D), whereas less SEPT9 was observed in subconfluent
cells. Similarly, CDT caused septin-colocalized protrusions in
polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Fig. S4 A
and B). Moreover, in primary colon epithelial cells, septins accu-
mulated at the base of CDT-induced protrusions (Fig. S5).
Previous studies showed that other F-actin–depolymerizing tox-
ins (e.g., Clostridium botulinumC2 toxin), which ADP-ribosylate
actin, induce protrusion formation (8). Moreover, the macrolide
toxin latrunculin A, which depolymerizes F-actin by a different
mechanism (19), causesprotrusion formation, although less pro-
nounced than actin-ADP–ribosylating toxins (8). We observed that
also latrunculin A induced protrusion-associated septin accumu-
lations (Fig. S6), indicating a general cellular mechanism.
Septins Are a Prerequisite for Protrusion Formation.To study whether
septin translocation is a prerequisite for protrusion formation, we
used shRNA knockdowns of SEPT2, -6, and -7 (Fig. 1E and Fig.
S7 A–E). Knockdown of SEPT6 and -7, but not of SEPT2, reduced
protrusion formation (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, overexpression
of SEPT6 and -7, but not of SEPT2, increased protrusion for-
mation (Fig. 1D and Fig. S7F and G). In Caco-2 cells, another
septin might take over for SEPT2 because other SEPT2 family
members were detected (Fig. S7H). The septin inhibitor for-
chlorfenuron (FCF), which interferes with septin dynamics (20),
reduced protrusion formation (Fig. 1F and Fig. S7I and J). FCF
did not affect CDT-induced ADP ribosylation of actin in intact
cells, thereby excluding interference of the compound with uptake
or enzyme activity of CDT (Fig. S7K). Notably, SEPT6 and -7
knockdown, SEPT6 and -7 overexpression, and FCF treatment
affected the overall number of protrusions as well as the average
length of protrusion.
Septins Are in Complex with the Cdc42 Effector Borg.Cdc42 and its
effector proteins Borg are involved in regulation of septins (21).
Therefore, we studied whether Borgs play a role in CDT-induced
protrusion formation. We found that in Caco-2 cells septins colo-
calized with expressed GFP-tagged versions of the Cdc42 effector

proteins Borg 1, -2, and -3 in filamentous structures (Fig. 2A). After
intoxication with CDT, septins formed chevron-like structures at the
membrane, and Borgs were localized at the base of toxin-induced
protrusions as a part of these structures (Fig. 2B and C). Control
cells with a strong Borg expression showed an increased microtu-
bule density and bundling at the cell cortex. These microtubule
bundles strongly associated with thick septin filaments (Fig. 2C).
Next, we analyzed the effects of the Cdc42-activating toxin
cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF1) (22, 23). Whereas CNF1
alone affected the actin cytoskeleton and increased formation of
stress fibers, the toxin caused minor or no changes of the septin
cytoskeleton. In CNF1-pretreated cells, CDT strongly increased
formation of septin rings all over the cell. At the cortex, the
chevron-like septin accumulations were changed to an undirected
formation of septin rings (Fig. 3A). Concomitantly, CNF1 pre-
treatment strongly reduced protrusion formation (Fig. 3 B),
indicating that accumulation and/or functions of septins are
downstream of Cdc42 and its effector protein Borg.
Similarly, expression of dominant active Cdc42 Q61E had no
effect on septins after 24 h of transfection. However, after CDT-
induced partial destruction of the actin cytoskeleton, the over-
expression of Cdc42 Q61E had a similar effect as CNF1 with
strongly increased formation of septin rings (Fig. 3C). The septin
rings colocalized with expressed GFP-Cdc42 Q61E, suggesting
that the GTPase Cdc42 is causally linked to ring formation.
Moreover, dominant active Cdc42 inhibited the formation of
protrusions (Fig. 3D). In line with these findings, we observed
that expression of the BD3 domain of Borg2, which was shown to
interact with septins, inhibited protrusion formation (Fig. 3D)
(21). To analyze the spatiotemporal regulation of Cdc42, cells
were transfected with a FRET sensor (24, 25). After 24 h, trans-
fected cells were treated with CDT and the activation of Cdc42
was monitored 1 h after toxin addition. The base of protrusions
revealed increased Cdc42 activity in ratio imaging (Fig. 4A and
B). In contrast, no increased RhoA activation was observed.
Septins Guide the Way of Microtubules.Fig. S8A shows plus-end
tracks of polymerizing microtubules, labeled by EB1, which
moved along septin filaments. In control cells, microtubules
polymerize along septin tracks. Upon CDT-induced actin de-
polymerization, septins were located at actin-free sites of the
membrane, forming unstructured clusters (Fig. 5A and Fig. S8B).
These clusters were predetermined sites of protrusion formation.
During initial growth and elongation of microtubule-based pro-
trusion, the septin accumulations mature to typical arch- or
chevron-like structures (Fig. 1B). After formation of a stable
septin base at the protrusion–cell membrane interface, further
polymerizing microtubules follow the leading microtubule in the
same track (Fig. S8C). Also microtubules that do not polymerize
in the same track are redirected at the protrusion base into the
protrusion (Fig. 5B and C).
Septins Interact with the Microtubule Plus-End.Septins are known
to bind microtubules (20). However, the structures involved are
largely enigmatic. We asked whether the plus-end tracking protein-1
(EB1), which is a master regulator of protein interactions at the
plus-ends of microtubules (21–2 5 ) ,p l a y sar o l ei ns e p t i n–micro-
tubule communication. In fact, GST–pull-down experiments with
EB1-loaded beads revealed a direct interaction of septins with
EB1. Septins were precipitated as purified His-tagged proteins
(Fig. S8D and E), as endogenous septins from Caco-2 cell lysates
(Fig. 5D–F)o rf r o mE B 1 - G F P–transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2G
and H). To quantify the interaction between EB1 and septin, we
used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. These studies revealed
an EB1–septin interaction affinity of aKd of 80± 12 nM for SEPT2,

Discussion
Here, we show that septins accumulate at the membrane after
cells were intoxicated with the actin-ADP–ribosylating toxin CDT.
Septins are well known to interact with anionic phospholipids (e.g.,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate) (26, 27). In our studies, the sites of septin
accumulation are characterized by spots of depolymerized cortical
actin, which may allow interaction with membrane phospholipids.
During protrusion formation the septin accumulations matured to
chevron-like or circular structures at the base of protrusions. In-
terestingly, a very similar angle-like structure of septins occurs at
the base of developing neurite branches (28). However, in neurites,
formation of actin filaments are crucial for collateral branching,
which is followed by accumulation of microtubules. Although in
neurites SEPT6 increases cortactin recruitment, which is essential
to trigger formation of actin-based axonal filopodia (28), we did
not detect any role of cortactin in CDT-induced protrusion for-
mation (Fig. S9). In our study, CDT causes local depolymerization
of actin, which is a prerequisite for septin-dependent, microtubule-
based protrusion formation. In fact, several findings indicate that
septins are essential for toxin-induced protrusion formation. While
overexpression of septins increased protrusion formation, septin
knockdown and treatment with FCF, an inhibitor of septin turn-
over (20), blocked formation of protrusions. Not only the number
but also the length of protrusions was affected by CDT treatment,
suggesting that septins are involved not only in initiation but also
in growth, dynamics, and stabilization of microtubule-based
protrusions. Accordingly, we also observed septins along the
protrusion shaft. Although knockdown of SEPT6 and SEPT7
clearly inhibited protrusion formation, knockdown of SEPT2 had
no effect, although it was part of the septin structure at the base
of protrusions. We assume that functional redundancy of other
septins (e.g., SEPT1 and SEPT5) from the SEPT2 group is re-
sponsible for protrusion formation after SEPT2 knockdown.
Studies from yeast and mammalian cells indicate that the small
GTPase Cdc42 plays an essential role in septin regulation (21, 29).
Accordingly, we observed locally increased activity of Cdc42 in
FRET experiments before and during protrusion formation. How-
ever, persistent activation of Cdc42 was inhibitory. When dominant
active Cdc42 or the Rho protein activator CNF1 was used, pro-
trusion formation was strongly inhibited. These findings suggest that
the free cycling of Cdc42 from the inactive to the active state
is necessary to fulfill septin regulatory functions. CNF1 and also

dominant active Cdc42 caused increased formation of septin
rings in the cytosol, whereas the membrane localization of sep-
tins with chevron-like structures were decreased. This is in line
with a role of cycling Cdc42 in septin membrane recruitment
observed in yeast and mammalian cells (30, 31). Moreover, the
persistently active form of Cdc42 may favor uncontrolled ring
formation of septins that prevents a spatiotemporal controlled
polymerization of septins at the site of protrusion formation.
Cdc42 effectors of the Borg family are suggested to play a
pivotal role in septin recruitment and organization (21, 32). Five
Borg family members (Borg1–5) are known (18). All Borgs bind
directly to septins via their BD3 domain (21). We could coloc-
alize Borg1–3 with septin filaments. After CDT treatment Borgs
colocalized with the chevron-like structures at the base of pro-
trusions. The regulation of Borgs by Cdc42 is not well understood.
Although Borgs bind to active GTP-bound Cdc42 in vitro (18), it
was shown that the active Cdc42 can displace Borg from septins.
Thus, Borg–septin interaction appears to be negatively regulated
by Cdc42 (21). Accordingly, we observed that Borgs were dis-
placed from protrusions after CNF treatment of cells.
Bowen et al. reported that septins track microtubule bundles (33).
Similarly, we observed tracking ofpolymerizing cytosolic microtu-
bules along septins in control cells. In CDT-treated cells, where
membrane-associated septin clusters had formed, microtubule tips
interacted with the chevron-like structures of septins. Moreover, we
observed that septins guided microtubules to form projections and
forced new directions of microtubule growth. This was evident when
microtubules contacted septins at distal parts of the chevron-like
structures. The septin interaction redirected the tip of microtubules
into the center of the septin“funnel,” where microtubules continued
to grow beyond the edge of the cell to form protrusions.
We show that septins interact with microtubules via EB1,
which is a multifunctional interaction partner at the microtubule
tip (21–25). Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon reso-
nance spectroscopy, exhibitingKd values in the nanomolar range,
revealed that septins bind directly to EB1. Previously, we showed
that toxin-induced protrusions contain endoplasmic reticulum,
which is connected to microtubulesvia stromal interaction mole-
cule 1 (Stim-1) (9). Stim-1 is involved in Stim/Orai-dependent
store-operated calcium entry, and septins are coordinators of Stim/
Orai channels (34). It remains to be studied whether Stim-1 is
another functional connection between microtubules and septins.
Taken together, here we show that the actin-ADP–ribosylating
toxin CDT ofC. difficileinduces septin accumulations at the cell
membrane, which are essential for the formation of toxin-induced
microtubule-based protrusions. This effect is regulated by Cdc42 and
most likely by Borg proteins. Septins guide growing microtubules and
determine the site of protrusion formation at the cell membrane by
interaction with EB1 at the tips of microtubules. Thus, the bacterial
toxin exploits septin-dependent regulatory mechanism of microtubule
organization to eventually form a network of cell protrusions and to
increase the adherence of the pathogen duringC. difficileinfection.

Immunostaining. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% (wt/vol) form-
aldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100
in PBS, and blocked. Incubation with the primary antibody was overnight at
4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with the suitable secondary anti-
body for 1 h. Cells were washed, dried, and embedded with Mowiol. Cells
were analyzed with the microscope mentioned inSI Methods. Images were
processed with Metamorph software.
Live-Cell Imaging.For live-cell imaging, cells were incubated in a chamber with
humidified atmosphere at 37 °C on the microscope (SI Methods, Immunos-
taining). Quantification of microtubule protrusion formation was performed
according to ref. 8.
FRET Experiments. Procedure for FRET measurements is given in the immu-
nostaining section. At each time point, three images were recorded for CFP,
FRET, and YFP. Donor (CFP) and FRET images were acquired sequentially with
exposure times ≤300 ms. Processing of ratiometric images was performed
with the Biosensor Processing Software 2.1 (Danuser laboratory:lccb.hms.
harvard.edu/software.html). Subsequent image analysis was performed in
MetaMorph. Ratio images were color-coded; warm and cold colors represent
high and low biosensor activity, respectively.
Pull-Down Assays and Coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in buffers
supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). For pull-down
experiments, lysates were incubated with GST or GST-EB1 bound to gluta-
thione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and subjected to Western blot analysis.
For pull-down of recombinant proteins, GST or GST-EB1 bound to gluta-
thione Sepharose 4B was incubated with purified His-tagged proteins.
For coimmunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated withμMacs GFP iso-
lation beads (Miltenyi Biotec). The beads were immobilized toμColumns and
after elution, proteins were detected by immunoblot.
Mice were housed and handled in accordance with good animal practice
as defined by FELASA (www.felasa.eu) and the national animal welfare body
GV-SOLAS (www.gv-solas.de).

Fig. 5. Microtubules are guided along septins. (A) Combined DIC and confocal images of Caco-2 cells. Cells were transfected with SEPT2-GFP and treated with CDT
(200 ng/mL CDTa and 400 ng/mL CDTb) for 170 min (white arrow, site of protrusion formation with preexisting septin accumulation). (Scale bar, 5μm.) (B) Caco-2
cells were transfected with SEPT6-tomato and EB3-GFP. The 55-s time-lapse sequence after CDT intoxication (as inA) for 1.5 h. Yellow arrowhead marks an EB3-
positive microtubule plus-end, approaching a septin structure at the protrusion base. White arrowhead marks the same plus-end pausing at the base ofprotrusion.
Cyan arrowhead shows redirection and fast entering into the protrusion. (C) Model for redirection of polymerizing microtubules into protrusions. Plus-ends of
polymerizing microtubules contact a septin chevron-like structure and are redirected into the protrusion. (D) Representative blot of an EB1-GST pull-down of
endogenous SEPT2 and SEPT7 from Caco-2 cell lysates. GST-loaded beads were used as a control. (E) Quantification of blots as inD for SEPT7. Blots were nor-
malized to the amount of SEPT7 in the lysate. Data are± SEM, n = 4. (F) Quantification of blots as inD for SEPT2. Blots were normalized to the amount of SEPT2 in
the lysate. Data are± SEM andn = 4. (G) Representative blot of a coimmunopreciptitation of SEPT2 along with EB1-GFP. HeLa cells were transfected with EB1-GFP
for 24 h. SEPT2 and EB1-GFP from the lysates were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody conjugated to magnetic beads. GFP-transfected cells were used
as control. (H) Quantification of blots as inG for SEPT2. Blots were normalized to the amount of EB1-GFP and GFP on beads. Data are± SEM andn = 3.
