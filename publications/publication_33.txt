during prototypical edge protrusion 
and retraction dynamics

The three canonical Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 co-ordinate cytoskeletal dynamics. Recent 
studies indicate that all three Rho GTPases are activated at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts, 
where their activity fluctuates at subminute time and micrometer length scales. Here, we use a 
microfluidic chip to acutely manipulate fibroblast edge dynamics by applying pulses of platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF) or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (which lowers contractility). This induces 
acute and robust membrane protrusion and retraction events, that exhibit stereotyped cytoskeletal 
dynamics, allowing us to fairly compare specific morphodynamic states across experiments. Using 
a novel Cdc42, as well as previously described, second generation RhoA and Rac1 biosensors, we 
observe distinct spatio-temporal signaling programs that involve all three Rho GTPases, during 
protrusion/retraction edge dynamics. Our results suggest that Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA regulate different 
cytoskeletal and adhesion processes to fine tune the highly plastic edge protrusion/retraction dynamics 
that power cell motility.
Rho GTPases regulate the actin and adhesion dynamics that power cell motility. Initial models have proposed 
that Rac1 controls membrane protrusion, Cdc42 regulates filopodia and polarity, and RhoA promotes myosin 
contractility during tail retraction 1. Measurements of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics using 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors have challenged this classic model. All three 
Rho GTPases have been observed to be active at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts2–6. Furthermore, distinct 
Rho GTPase activity pools can be simultaneously activated at different subcellular locations - RhoA activity is 
associated with protrusion, tail retraction, and ruffling5; Cdc42 is activated in protrusions, filopodia, and at the 
Golgi4; Rac1 activity occurs during protrusion and ruffling3, but also controls invadopodia disassembly7. At the 
leading edge, the RhoA GTPase activation pattern can also depend on a specific stimulus – while fibronectin 
induces protrusions with high RhoA activity, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) leads to protrusions with 
reduced RhoA activity5. A correct understanding of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics therefore 
requires us to focus on context-dependent, specific subcellular morphodynamic processes, rather than on the 
entire cell8,9. Consistently, computational multiplexing of Rho GTPase activation dynamics has revealed precise, 
subminute time and micrometer length scale, co-ordination of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities during edge 
protrusion/retraction cycles10. Specific patterns of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activation can also be observed at the 
leading edge of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells11. Further, spatio-temporal signaling programs involving more than 
one Rho GTPase have been documented during Xenopus Laevis oocyte wounding8, or macropinocytosis12. While 
we start to unravel the diversity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling programs in different morphodynamic 
processes, their inherent complexity impedes a clear understanding of how they regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. 
Here, we take a reductionist approach, in which we study RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activation dynamics

during robust, prototypical edge protrusion/retraction events. This provides novel insight into how the three Rho 
GTPases co-operate to fine tune the cytoskeletal dynamics that power edge motility.
Results
Pulsed PDGF/Y-27632 application induces robust protrusion and retraction states. We used 
a flow-based, programmable microfluidic device (Fig. S1A) to manipulate edge dynamics through a 30 minutes 
pulse of growth factors/drugs that elicit cytoskeletal responses. REF52 rat embryonic fibroblasts were seeded 
in fibronectin-coated microfluidic devices for one hour, leading to an isotropic spreading state. Throughout all 
experiments, we co-imaged an Alexa 647-labeled dextran as a quality control for compound application/removal 
(Fig. S1B). The low level of flow in our microfluidic platform did not affect edge morphodynamics (Fig. S1C,D). 
In contrast, application of PDGF induced robust edge protrusion, while its removal led to immediate edge retrac-
tion (Fig. S1C,D, Movie S1). We focused on two distinct stimuli to manipulate cell edge dynamics. First, we stud-
ied PDGF because it induces robust protrusion with low RhoA activity5,13, raising the question which Rac1/Cdc42 
activation dynamics could be associated with this morphodynamic state. Second, we used the Rho kinase-specific 
drug Y-2763214 that leads to protrusion by reducing intracellular contractility, and thus bypasses the need for an 
extracellular signal. This might provide insight into how an internal cytoskeletal state is interpreted to activate 
signaling responses.
To get insight in the edge morphodynamics evoked by a PDGF or Y-27632 pulse, we tracked edge velocities 
during three distinct motility states: 1. 30 minutes before pulse application, 30 minutes of PDGF +  Y-27632 pulse, 
30 minutes immediately after PDGF/Y-27632/PDGF +  Y-27632 washout. These three different edge motility 
states were timelapsed with a two minute time resolution. Before pulse application, a steady-state consisting of 
poorly protruding/retracting edges was observed (Fig. 1A,B). Previous analysis of steady-state edge dynamics had 
revealed cycles of protrusions and retractions, both with a persistence time of approximately 80 seconds15. Upon 
PDGF application, an almost isotropic burst of membrane protrusion persisted for a couple of minutes, until the 
edge stalled (Fig. 1A, Movie S1). PDGF withdrawal then led to edge retraction, again on a time scale of multiple 
minutes. In contrast, Y-27632 induced protrusions without a characteristic stalling phase (Fig. 1B, Movie S2).  
Edge retraction then immediately occurred after Y-27632 removal. These two distinct edge dynamics were also 
obvious when cell area was evaluated over time (Fig. 1C). Stimulation with both PDGF and Y-27632 recapitulated 
the Y-27632-evoked morphodynamics (Fig. S2A,B). These results indicate that our microfluidic platform induces 
robust protrusion and retraction events that occur on a different timescale than the edge dynamics observed at 
steady-state (e.g. multiple minutes rather than tens of seconds). Furthermore, distinct edge dynamics are evoked 
by the two stimuli. Upon combined PDGF +  Y-27632 stimulation, identical edge motility behaviors as in response 
to Y-27632 alone are observed.
Specific F-actin and adhesion dynamics correlate with prototypical edge protrusion/retraction 
events. We then evaluated cytoskeletal dynamics associated with steady, protrusion, stalling or retraction 
phases. Importantly, these dynamic states were not homogeneous across the cell edge. We therefore systemati -
cally gated our analysis on edge positions at which robust dynamic states occurred. In subsequent experiments, 
in which additional markers and FRET biosensors were imaged, we systematically monitored F-actin dynamics 
using Lifeact-mCherry, allowing for correlation across experiments. Different markers and biosensors were deliv-
ered using lentiviral and/or adenoviral vectors, enabling homogeneous and finely-tuned expression levels, not 
detrimental to cell function.
Analysis of F-actin dynamics during the steady-state phase revealed a prominent array of radial stress fib-
ers16,17 , indicating the presence of robust, actin retrograde flow in the lamella (Fig. 1D, Movie S1). Upon 
PDGF-induced membrane protrusion, this lamellar radial stress fiber network decompacted, and diminished in 
intensity. This was accompanied by formation of a robust lamellipodial network throughout, and directly at the 
cell edge (Fig. 1D). During the stalling phase, a radial stress fiber array then re-enforced about ten micrometers 
from the edge, while the edge lamellipodial network subsisted (Fig. 1D). PDGF withdrawal-induced retraction 
was characterized by lamellipodium disappearance, formation of edge retraction fibers, and condensation of the 
radial stress fiber lamellar network (Fig. 1D).
Y-27632 application led to immediate loss of the lamellar radial stress fibers, associated with strong protru-
sion propelled by lamellipodial networks (Fig. 1E, Movie S2). Edge retraction was again characterized by loss of 
the lamellipodial network, appearance of retraction fibers, as well as reformation of a lamellar radial stress fiber 
network. Both in response to PDGF or Y-27632 washout-triggered edge retraction, the intensity of the lamellar 
radial stress fibers network did however not recover to pre-pulse levels (Fig. 1F).
We then co-imaged F-actin and adhesion dynamics (V ASP-GFP) in response to PDGF or Y-27632 pulses 
(Fig. 2A,C, left panels). At steady edges, elongated focal adhesions with characteristic centripetal sliding were 
observed. This is consistent with the robust actin retrograde flow that induces efficient conversion of focal com-
plexes to focal adhesions (Fig. 2A,B, Movie S3). PDGF-evoked membrane protrusion led to formation of focal 
complexes that remained immobile with respect to the substrate, but then matured into focal adhesions during 
stalling. During edge retraction, these focal adhesions then increasingly elongated, and exhibited robust centrip-
etal sliding.
Y-27632 led to immediate focal adhesions dissolution, leaving only small remnant adhesions (Fig. 2C,D, Movie S4).  
During retraction, focal adhesions were again formed from the remnant adhesion templates. Evaluation of 
V ASP-GFP fluorescence intensities revealed a potent decrease in adhesion density in response to both PDGF 
and Y-27632, that however recovered to some extent during retraction, but never to pre-pulse levels (Fig. 2E,F).
Consistently with the finding of similar edge dynamics for both Y-27632, and PDGF +  Y-27632 stimulation, 
identical F-actin (Fig. S2C,D) and adhesion dynamics (Fig. S2E,F) were again observed for both edge motility

states. Together, these results indicate that specific F-actin and adhesion dynamics correlate with different edge 
motility states that are induced by PDGF , Y-27632, or combined application of PDGF +  Y-27632.
Construction of a FRET-based, Cdc42 activity biosensor. To visualize Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA activi-
ties, we used FRET-based biosensors. Multiple existing FRET-based biosensors report on RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 
activation dynamics2,4–7,13,18 with different levels of sensitivity. However, some of these probes are constitutively 
tethered to the plasma-membrane2,6, and therefore cannot integrate any level of regulation exerted by Rho gua-
nine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). At least for RhoA, this has been shown to be crucial to faithfully 
capture Rho GTPase activity patterns in time and space13. Using our cpFRET toolkit, which is based on a bio-
sensor library with circularly permutated (cp) donor and acceptor fluorophores, we have previously constructed 
more sensitive, second generation, RhoA13, and Rac1 19 biosensors (called RhoA-2G and Rac1-2G). We now 
report on the construction of a second generation, Cdc42-2G biosensor. For that purpose, we used a biosensor 
design that was successful in producing improved RhoA and Rac1 biosensors. This design includes wild type and 
four cps of the mTFP1 donor and Venus acceptor fluorophores, the W ASP CRIB domain (amino-acids 201-314) 
to detect Cdc42 GTP-loading4, and Cdc42 at the C-terminus (Fig. 3A).
Screening of the library yielded three sensor constructs (mTFP1/cp227-Venus/cp157, mTFP1/cp227-Venus/
cp195, mTFP1/cp175-Venus/wt) that displayed a robust change in emission ratio (ER) between ON and OFF 
states (Fig. 3B and S3A). We discarded the mTFP1/cp175-Venus/wt biosensor because mTFP1/cp175 displays 
a lower brightness than mTFP1/cp22713. Because the two remaining biosensors both contained mTFP1/cp227, 
we then arbitrarily chose the mTFP1/cp227-Venus/cp195 sensor variant for further investigation (Fig. S3B). 
Cdc42-2G showed a pronounced inversion of the donor and FRET emissions in the ON and OFF states (Fig. 3C), 
and appropriately responded to mutations that affect nucleotide loading (G12V and T17N) or effector interaction 
(Y40C)20 (Fig. 3D, S3C). Cdc42-2G responded to co-expression of Cdc42-competent Rho GTPase activating 
proteins (GAPs) such as a truncated form of CdGAP (CdGAP ∆N) or p50RhoGAP , but not the Rap1-specific 
RapGAP (Fig. 3E). Due to its specific design, Cdc42-2G also responded to RhoGDI. This drop of activity could 
then be rescued by co-expression of the Cdc42-competent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Dbl, but not 
by non Cdc42-competent GEFs like Etc2 (RhoA-specific), Vav1 (Rac1-specific) or C3G (Rap1-specific). Finally, 
we analyzed the spatial Cdc42 activation patterns in living cells. As observed earlier 4,18, Cdc42-2G detected 
broad Cdc42 activation at the cell edge (Fig. 3F). The Cdc42-2G T17N mutant, which retained a similar subcel-
lular localization as Cdc42-2G, however yielded a flat emission ratio profile (Fig. 3F ,G). This indicates that the 
Cdc42-2G sensor faithfully reflects Cdc42 activation pattern independently of cell geometry. A sequence map of 
Cdc42-2G is provided in Fig. S3D.
Spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics associated with prototypical protrusion/
retraction events.  We then monitored the activity of each Rho GTPase simultaneously with F-actin dynam-
ics, and analyzed Rho GTPase activity fluctuations using kymograph analysis (Fig. 4A). Visual inspection guided 
us in identifying specific regions of interest (ROIs) within the kymograph, to quantify temporal averages of Rho 
GTPase activity during specific signaling states (Fig. 4B). Based on these measurements, a schematic representa-
tion of Rho GTPase activity fluctuation is presented (Fig. 4C). We also plotted the mean ER value across the 
whole kymograph, to provide an idea of the relative changes of local versus basal Rho GTPase activity (Figs 4 and 
5B,E,H, grey boxplot).
As previously shown 15, a broad gradient of RhoA activity spanning several micrometers from the edge 
inwards, occurred at the steady-state (Fig. 4A–C, Movie S5). PDGF-induced protrusion led to rapid RhoA inhi-
bition throughout the cell. During subsequent stalling, RhoA activity then re-appeared at the leading edge. RhoA 
activity then remained ON during membrane retraction. At steady-state, basal levels of Rac1 activity occurred 
throughout the cell (Fig. 4D–F , Movie S6). During protrusion, Rac1 activity immediately increased and con-
centrated in a more focused edge-proximal region, and remained ON during stalling. During retraction, the 
edge-proximal Rac1 activity zone immediately switched OFF , and a second zone of edge-distal Rac1 activity 
appeared. These results suggest the existence of two distinct Rac1 activity pools that are differently regulated dur-
ing protrusion and retraction. At steady-state, Cdc42 was activated in a broad zone at the leading edge (Fig. 4G–I, 
Movie S7). Cdc42 activity then intensified during PDGF-induced protrusion, stalling and retraction.
Identical measurements in response to Y-27632 revealed a slightly different scenario. Differently from 
PDGF-triggered protrusions, RhoA activity remained ON throughout the different morphodynamic events 
(Fig. 5A–C, Movie S8). In contrast, similar Rac1 and Cdc42 activation dynamics as in response to PDGF were 
observed (Fig. 5D–I, Movies S9,10). Consistently with identical edge morphodynamics as well as F-actin and 
adhesion dynamics evoked by Y-27632 or PDGF +  Y-27632 stimulation, similar spatio-temporal Rho GTPase 
activation dynamics were observed by both stimulation protocols (Fig. S4). These results indicate the existence

of finely regulated spatio-temporal RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling programs that correlate with the different 
F-actin and adhesion dynamics evoked by the different stimuli. A summary of the different edge motility states as 
well as their associated F-actin, adhesion and Rho GTPase activation dynamics is shown in Fig. 6.
Discussion
Recent reports have documented complex Rho GTPase signaling programs that regulate leading edge dynamics, 
and that fluctuate at length and time scales of single microns and tens of seconds9–11. With respect to more classic 
models, this reveals an unanticipated degree of complexity, in which the different Rho GTPases most likely acti-
vate different effector pathways in time and space, to fine tune cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics that enable 
leading edge motility. Understanding this signaling complexity requires reductionist approaches that allow us to 
gate on specific morphodynamic events (e.g. leading edge motility versus tail retraction,…). Because these com-
plex signaling programs correlate with rapid and heterogeneous dynamic edge motility states, computer vision 
and statistical analyses are required to extract the subtle Rho GTPase signaling patterns, and merge them into 
statistically-relevant datasets10,11. Here, we use a microfluidic device to induce robust prototypical edge motility 
behaviors, bypassing cellular heterogeneity to some extent, and allowing us to analyze signaling dynamics using 
more simple methods. We use our approach to dissect specific Rho GTPase signaling states that are associated 
with distinct edge motility, F-actin and adhesion dynamics. These prototypical edge motility, and their associated 
signaling states, operate at a time scale of multiple minutes rather than ten seconds as those observed during 
fibroblast edge dynamics evoked by simple integrin engagement10.
F-actin and adhesion dynamics correlating with different edge motility states.  Our approach 
reveals stereotypic cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics associated with the integrin-triggered, poorly motile 
steady state, and the more robust protrusion and retraction edge motility states induced by PDGF or Y-27632 
pulses (Fig. 6A). At steady-state, REF52 cells display robust lamellar actin retrograde flow, most likely in equilib-
rium with actin polymerization, leading to low net protrusion. This is visible from the robust retrograde flow of 
radial stress fibers, accompanied by robust focal adhesion maturation. During PDGF-evoked, steady protrusion, 
the lamellar F-actin network decreases in intensity (as evidenced by a decrease in the intensity of radial stress fib-
ers), and a clear lamellipodial F-actin network is formed. Consistently, this is accompanied with formation of focal 
complexes that do not mature into focal adhesions. Together, these data strongly suggest decreased myosin-based 
contractility during PDGF-evoked membrane protrusion. After a couple of minutes, the PDGF-induced edge 
stalls. We propose that edge geometry/mechanical cues are sensed to activate a mechanical feedback that limits 
membrane extension, possibly enabling not to overwhelm the limited membrane supply required for protrusion. 
This correlates with re-enforcement of radial stress fibers, and focal adhesion maturation, indicative of increased 
myosin-based contractility. However, a robust lamellipodial network can still be observed. We therefore propose 
that an equilibrium between lamellipodial actin polymerization and lamellar actin retrograde flow leads to PDGF 
edge stalling. Upon PDGF removal, loss of the protrusive lamellipodial actin network, together with continuous 
lamellar retrograde actin flow correlates with robust edge retraction.
In contrast to PDGF , Y-27632 triggers very robust edge protrusion without a stalling phase (Fig. 6A). This 
correlates with formation of robust lamellipodial networks, as well as with an instantaneous loss of lamellar actin 
retrograde flow, evidently due to inhibition of Rho kinase and myosin-based contractility. This is visible due to 
disappearance of radial stress fibers, and dissolution of focal adhesions, with only some small remnant adhesions 
remaining. Compromised mechanosensing due to Y-27632 might also not enable to evoke the stalling phase 
observed when membrane protrusion is activated using PDGF . Simultaneous stimulation of cells with a pulse of 
PDGF and Y-27632 evoke identical edge motility, cytoskeletal and adhesions dynamics than Y-27632 alone, indicat-
ing that compromised mechanosensing is dominant over chemotropic, PDGF-induced responses (Figs S2 and S4).  
Not surprisingly, this indicates that mechanosensitive signaling also feeds in the regulation of chemotropic 
responses. Upon Y-27632 removal, lamellipodial F-actin networks disappear, while lamellar networks re-appear, 
correlating with edge retraction.
Together, these results suggest that the robust prototypical edge motility states we can induce originate from 
the interplay of the lamellipodial and lamellar actin networks. Tuning of the strength of both cytoskeletal net-
works ultimately dictates the edge motility state of the cell.
Spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics associated to prototypical edge motility 
states. Rather than a universal signaling modality regulating leading egde motility, our results indicate the 
existence of sophisticated spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling networks regulating edge protrusion and retrac-
tion. These depend both, on external cues (integrin versus growth factor signaling) and intrinsic cytoskeletal 
properties (the contractile state of the cell). This might enable to fine tune the cytoskeletal dynamics inherent to 
different edge motility states. While our approach remains purely correlative, our results suggest that the complex 
interplay between Rho GTPases might control the balance between lamellipodial actin polymerization versus 
for a fair comparison of fluorescence intensities. (E,F) Quantification of adhesion fluorescence intensity in

lamellar actin retrograde flow during edge protrusion, stalling or retraction episodes. Indeed, we can at present 
only speculate about the possible effector pathways that are switched on in time and space by the different Rho 
GTPases. A summary of the spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics during the different edge dynam-
ics are shown in Fig. 6A,B.
During steady-state, relatively silent edge motility, broad zones of basal Rac1/Cdc42 activities might regulate 
actin polymerization by activation of Wave/W ASP and Arp2/3 proteins21, while the broad zone of RhoA activity 
might control lamellar myosin II-dependent actin through Rho kinases22. Consistently, in REF52 cells, lamellar 
actin retrograde flow and the broad gradient of RhoA activity also correlate with phosphorylated myosin light 
chain23. We propose that the interplay of both signaling activities, and their antagonistic downstream cytoskeletal 
networks explains the poor net edge protrusion.
During PDGF-evoked membrane protrusion, Rac1 and Cdc42 get activated beyond their steady-state levels, 
in regions that are more focused at the leading edge, while RhoA activity immediately decreases. Increased (Rac1/
Cdc42-dependent) Arp2/3 activation, coupled with decreased (RhoA-dependent) myosin-based retrograde flow 
might then explain the steady membrane protrusion observed during that phase. These observations suggest 
that the widely described Rac1/RhoA antagonism24 might take place in this specific cellular context. The almost 
immediate decrease in RhoA activity upon PDGF stimulation suggests the involvement of a rapidly diffusible 
secondary messenger that might consist of reactive oxygen species, that have previously been described to medi-
ate the Rac1/RhoA antagonism25. The finding that Rac1 and RhoA activity zones overlap during steady state 
protrusion, stalling, and Y-27632-evoked protrusion, suggest that the Rac1/RhoA antagonism is not a universal 
signaling mechanism, but occurs within specific cellular contexts.
During stalling, Rac1/Cdc42 activity and a lamellipodium remain present. However, a potential mechanosen-
sitive pathway26, seems to re-activate RhoA and re-enforce actin retrograde flow to counteract actin polymeri-
zation and stall the edge. Edge retraction then correlates with loss of edge-proximal Rac1 activity, and activation 
of a second, edge-distal, Rac1 pool. RhoA, and surprisingly also Cdc42 remain active. An attractive possibility is 
that edge-proximal Rac1 inactivation, correlates with loss of Wave/Arp2/3-mediated activation of lamellipodial 
actin polymerization. In presence of continuous RhoA-mediated actin retrograde flow, edge motility is tipped 
towards retraction. The significance of continuous Cdc42 activity during retraction is less clear. One scenario is 
that Cdc42 switches to another effector such as myotonic dystrophy related kinase MRCK, which can co-operate 
with Rho/Rho kinase signaling to control myosin light chain phosphorylation, and thus contractility27. The signif-
icance of the appearance of an edge-distal Rac1 activity pool that correlates with retraction is also non-intuitive. 
However, at this subcellular location, the use of a different effector such as p21 activated kinase (PAK) could feed 
into the cofilin pathway. Such a spatio-temporal Rac1 signaling network has recently been linked to actin depo-
lymerization during invadosome disassembly7.
Our Y-27632 experiments revealed similar spatio-temporal Rac1/Cdc42 activity patterns as for PDGF , show-
ing that these GTPases can sense intracellular variations in contractility, and feed into the regulation of mem-
brane protrusion. RhoA however remained switched ON throughout all morphodynamic phases, even during 
membrane protrusion. In the latter case, it is important to notice that RhoA won’t contribute to contractile sig-
naling since its effector, Rho kinase, is inhibited. Consistently with previous reports 26,28, these results suggest 
that compromised mechanosensing in absence of contractility results in an inability to tune RhoA activation 
dynamics. We show that simultaneous PDGF and Y-27632 pulse lead to identical edge, cytoskeletal, adhesion, 
and spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling dynamics as a simple Y-27632 pulse does. These results underline the 
importance of mechanosensitive pathways for spatio-temporal control of Rho GTPase activation.
Our results, as well as previous work that has focused on fibroblast edge dynamics that fluctuate on a more 
rapid timescale10 indicate a high degree of complexity of Rho GTPase signaling during fibroblast cell migration. 
The coming task will now be to characterize the GEFs/GAPs that dynamically shape spatio-temporal patterns of 
Rho GTPase activity, the mechanisms of the crosstalk between Rho GTPases, and the specific effector pathways 
that are associated with each Rho GTPase pool to fine tune the different cytoskeletal networks that produce spe-
cific edge motility behaviors. Because Rho GTPase activation dynamics fluctuate at second/minute timescales, 
adequate dissection of this signaling complexity will require optogenetic/chemical biology tools that enable to 
apply perturbations and manipulate signaling dynamics at these specific timescales.
Material and methods
Cdc42 biosensor generation.  The Cdc42 FRET biosensor was constructed using the cpFRET toolkit (Fritz 
et al., 2013). Based on the design of the most sensitive second generation RhoA sensor, we constructed 25 sensor 
variants consisting of mTFP1 wt and four circular permutations (cps), the CRIB effector domain of W ASP (amino 
acids 201–314; custom gene synthesis; GenScript), a 64 amino acid linker, Venus wt and four cps and Cdc42 itself 
(custom gene synthesis; GenScript). The design including restriction sites used for cloning as well as the sequence 
Cdc42-2G mutants. Indicated mutants were transfected and analyzed by fluorometry. n =  2 experiments.

of the second generation Cdc42 (Cdc42-2G) sensor is shown in Fig. S3. This biosensor design preserves the 
C-terminal lipid modification of Cdc42, which renders the GTPase sensitive to the regulation by RhoGDI. This 
is a prerequisite to faithfully capture the spatiotemporal activation pattern of endogenous GTPases as observed 
previously13. The most sensitive Cdc42-2G sensor containing mTFP1/cp227 and Venus/cp195 was shuttled from 
pTriEx into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST Gateway®  Vector according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). 
The dominant negative (T17N) and effector (Y40C) mutations as well as the dominant positive (G12V) mutation 
were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).
Cdc42 FRET biosensor characterization by fluorometry and microscopy.  Analysis of the fluores-
cence emission spectra of the Cdc42 biosensor library and Cdc42-2G dominant positive and negative mutants 
were performed on a fluorometer (Perkin Elmer LS50b). Typically, 2 ×  105 HEK293FT cells were seeded into a 
12-well cell culture plate and transfected with 100 ng of biosensor, 400 ng of RhoGDI or GAPs and 1000 ng of 
GEFs using Metafectene (Biontex). After 48  hours, cells were detached with brief trypsin treatment and resus -
pended in ice-cold PBS. Cell suspensions were measured in a quartz cuvette. Cdc42 sensor was excited at 460 nm 
and emission spectra were recorded from 480–600 nm with a step of 0.5 nm. Spectra were background-subtracted 
with the spectra of non-transfected cells and normalized according to their spectrum integral. Relative FRET 
was calculated by dividing the normalized fluorescence intensity of Venus at its emission peak (528 nm) by the 
normalized fluorescence intensity of mTFP1 at its emission peak (492 nm). The response of the Cdc42-2G sensor 
to GEFs and GAPs was analyzed by microscopy. HEK293FT cells were seeded into 96-well plate (Falcon) coated 
with 10 μ g/ml Poly-L-lysine and transfected as described above. 9 fields of view were acquired per experiment 
using a Plan Apo 10x objective and the Screening Acquisition Module in MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) and 
the average ratio per field of view was than calculated from ≥ 100 cells.
Cell culture, generation of stable cell lines and infection with adenoviral vectors.  Rat embry-
onic fibroblasts (REF52) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin/ streptomycin (Sigma) and 4 mM L-Glutamine 
(Sigma). For serum starvation and imaging, Ham’s Nutrient Mixture F12 (Ham’s F12, Sigma), supplemented with 
0.5% FBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin/ streptomycin, 4 mM L-Glutamine 
was used.
Stable cell lines expressing V ASP-GFP , or the RhoA FRET biosensor RhoA2G were described previously15. 
Similarly, stable cell lines expressing Paxillin-mCherry were constructed. For simultaneous imaging of F-actin 
dynamics, these stable cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding Lifeact-mCherry15. Long term expression 
of Rac1-2G19, and Cdc42-2G (this study) using lentiviral transduction led to obvious cell morphological aber -
rations. This problem was solved by short-term biosensor expression using adenoviral vectors. In these exper -
iments, double infections with adenoviruses encoding for Rac1-2G or Cdc42-2G, and Lifeact-mCherry were 
performed. Adenoviral particles from crude packaging cell lysates were frozen as aliquots. After titration, these 
crude lysates were used at appropriate concentration for cell infection. REF52 cells were infected for 16 hours, and 
switched to complete medium for 24 hours. Cells were then seeded in microfluidic devices in starving medium, 
and imaging started one hour post-seeding.
Construction and handling of microfluidic devices.  We used a modified version of a 
previously-described microfluidic circuit to apply chemokine gradient to cells29. Slight modifications of the con-
struction of the microfluidic circuit allowed us to deliver growth factor pulses. The microfluidic silicon master 
was replicated from a Silicon wafer with SU-8 micro-structures. The silicon master mold was composed of two 40 
μ m and 100 μ m thickness layers of photoresist. First, the plasma treated Silicon wafer was spin-coated with SU-8 
100 (Microchem, USA) negative thick photoresist until a height of 40 μ m was achieved. After baking at 65 °C for 
5′ and 95 °C for 20′, the wafer was exposed to 405 nm ultraviolet light (Shinu MST, Korea) with a 250 mJ dose and 
masked by the negative film mask (Han&All Tech, Korea). After this first round of exposure, the wafer was baked 
again at 65 °C for 1′ and 95 °C for 10′. SU-8 developer (Microchem, USA) was then used to remove the unexposed 
part of the photoresist. For deposition of the second photoresist layer, the film mask for the second master was 
correctly positioned using the alignment pattern on the first layer of the wafer. The photoresist for the second 
layer was then spin-coated until a 100 μ m thickness was achieved. The wafer was baked at 65 °C for 10′ and 95 °C 
for 30′, and exposed to 500 mJ of 405 nm UV light. After a final baking step at 65 °C for 1′ and 95 °C for 10′, the 
wafer was dipped into the developer, and baked to evaporate the residual solvents on the top.
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to replicate the master. The precursor (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) 
was mixed at a 10:1 ratio and degassed in a vacuum chamber for 5′. 7 g precursor was then poured on the top of 
the master, and solidified at 80 °C in a dry oven for 30′. The plastic reservoir from a 8-well strip (Evergreen sci,

USA) was then glued on top of the microfluidic device using precursor. These reservoirs contain the medium and 
growth factors, and allow us to connect the microfluidic device to the ONIX pressure pump (Millipore). An addi-
tional layer of 30 gr. of precursor was added to seal the plastic reservoir. As shown in Supplementary Information 
Fig. 1A, the PDMS replica was cut and punched. Glass coverslips (50 ×  70 mm) were thoroughly washed with 
anhydrous ethanol and demineralized water subsequently. PDMS devices were placed bottom side up together 
with dried coverslips into a CUTE plasma oven (Femto Science) and plasma treated at 100% power for 1′. After 
plasma treatment, the PDMS device was mounted on the glass coverslip and further incubated for 15′  at 70 °C 
to enhance efficiency of covalent bonding. Devices were then coated with 20 μ g/ml fibronectin, and stored over 
night at 4 °C prior to imaging experiments.
Live cell imaging. One hour prior to imaging, cells were reseeded subconfluently on fibronectin-coated 
microfluidic devices under serum starving conditions using Ham’s F12 starvation medium. Tubing connected to 
a pressure pump (ONIX, Millipore) was plugged to the inlets of the device and outlet reservoirs were covered with 
Parafilm to minimize medium evaporation.
One out of the two inlets of each device was filled with Ham’s F12 medium alone, while the other was loaded 
with Ham’s F12 supplemented with 4 μ M 10 kDa Dextran-Alexa 647 (Invitrogen), 40 ng/ml of PDGF or 10 μ g/ml 
Y27632, respectively. Immediately after, pressure of 0.5 psi on the reservoir was applied on the inlet containing 
only medium to prevent diffusion of PDGF or Y27632 into the cell chamber of the microfluidic device. During 
the PDGF/Y-27632 pulse experiments, medium exchanges were performed applying 1 psi for two minutes and 
further pressure was reduced to 0.5 psi for medium maintenance.
All imaging experiments were performed on an Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with

Adhesion dynamics are displayed in the second row, relating the fate of focal complexes (green) as well as focal 
adhesions (red) to the respective dynamic state. Below, a scheme summarizes Rho GTPase activation states in a 
qualitative way, referring to previously depicted edge-/F-actin and adhesion dynamics (RhoA, yellow; Rac1, red; 
Cdc42,blue). (B,C) Observations of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation throughout the course of PDGF (B) 
or Y-27632 (C) pulse experiments are summarized side by side in schematic kymographs.

objectives controlled by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software. Laser-based autofocus was used through-
out the experiments. A CoolLED lamp with 440 nm (mTeal excitation), or GYR LEDs (mCherry or Alexa647 
excitation) were used as light sources with appropriate excitation filters. FRET experiments were performed 
as described elsewhere13. For TIRF imaging, 491 or 561 nm solid-state laser diodes integrated within a TIRF 
illumination system were used (Roper Scientific). FRET/mCherry illumination experiments were acquired 
using a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera. GFP/mCherry TIRF imaging experiments were acquired using a 
Photometrics Evolve EMCCD. All images were acquired at 16-bit depth.
Image Analysis. Basic image analysis and processing was performed using MetaMorph software. FRET 
data were analyzed as described elsewhere 13. Edge velocities were assessed using the ImageJ plugin ADAPT 30. 
Adhesion intensities at distinct dynamic events were analyzed employing the Focal Adhesion Analysis Server 
(FAAS)31.
