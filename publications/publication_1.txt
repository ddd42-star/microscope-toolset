The human CTLH/GID (hGID) complex emerged as an important E3
ligase regulating multiple cellular processes, including cell cycle
progression and metabolism. However, the range of biological
functions controlled by hGID remains unexplored. Here, we used
proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID2) to identify proteins
interacting with the hGID complex, among them, substrate can-
didates that bind GID4 in a pocket-dependent manner. Bio-
chemical and cellular assays revealed that the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase
binds and ubiquitinates ARHGAP11A, thereby targeting this
RhoGAP for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, GID4 depletion or
impeding the GID4 substrate binding pocket with the PFI-7 in-
hibitor stabilizes ARHGAP11A protein amounts, although it carries
no functional N-terminal degron. Interestingly, GID4 inactivation
impairs cell motility and directed cell movement by increasing
ARHGAP11A levels at the cell periphery, where it inactivates RhoA.
Together, we identiﬁed a wide range of hGIDGID4 E3 ligase sub-
strates and uncovered a unique function of the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase
regulating cell migration by targeting ARHGAP11A.

Introduction
The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is a key protein degra-
dation machinery in eukaryotic cells. Conjugation of ubiquitin to
target proteins is achieved by three coordinated enzymatic reac-
tions, governed by activating E1, conjugating E2, and ligating E3
enzymes. E3 ligases perform the critical function of substrate
recognition, in some cases by detecting speciﬁc short amino acid
motifs called degrons ( Henneberg & Schulman, 2021 ; Dikic &
Schulman, 2023). Ubiquitin conjugation to substrate proteins reg-
ulates various cellular processes, including cellular homeostasis,
metabolism, and cell cycle progression (Brandon Croft, 2015).
Dysfunctions in the UPS, including mutations in the ubiquitin
machinery or in substrate recognition motifs, have been associated
with a broad spectrum of pathological conditions including cancer
and metabolic diseases (Kitamura, 2023).
In yeast, the UPS tightly controls the metabolic switch from
gluconeogenesis to glycolysis. This process involves glucose-
induced degradation-deﬁcient (GID) proteins, also known as the
C-terminal to LisH (CTLH), which form a multi-subunit RING
domain–containing E3 ligase (Santt et al, 2008). Biochemical and
structural analyses revealed that the yeast GID complex is com-
posed of seven subunits, and four such units assemble into a stable
tetramer (Menssen et al, 2012; Sherpa et al, 2021). Gid7 acts as a
supramolecular assembly factor allowing the formation of higher
order complexes. The catalytic center is formed by the two RING
domain–containing proteins Gid2 and Gid9, which are held together
by the scaffold Gid8. Gid5 recruits different substrate receptors
including Gid4, Gid10, and Gid11 (Kong et al, 2021). Gid4 promotes
proteasomal degradation of excess gluconeogenic enzymes such
as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1 (Fbp1) or malate dehydrogenase
(Mdh2) (Chen et al, 2017; Dong et al, 2020). These substrates are
recognized via a Pro/N-terminal degron motif, which docks into a
conserved Gid4 binding pocket. Similarly, Gid10 and Gid11 target
distinct sets of substrates that regulate speciﬁc metabolic transi-
tions (Kong et al, 2021; Langlois et al, 2022).
The GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex is evolutionarily conserved, and
all yeast subunits have closely related counterparts in higher
eukaryotes (Salemi et al, 2017; Lampert et al, 2018; Maitland et al,
2019). RanBP9 (Gid1), RMND5A (Gid2), ARMC8 (Gid5), TWA1 (Gid8), and
MAEA (Gid9) are ubiquitously expressed and assemble into mul-
timeric complexes localizing to the nucleus and cytoplasm
(Kobayashi et al, 2007). The two RING domain–containing subunits
RMND5A and MAEA linked by TWA1 form the catalytic trimer
(Lampert et al, 2018), which assembles with other subunits such as
WDR26 (Gid7), RanBP9/RanBP10 (Gid1), MKLN1, GID4 (Gid), ARMC8
(Gid5), and YPEL5 (Fig 1A)( Kobayashi et al, 2007; Lampert et al, 2018).

nism and assembly of hGID E3 ligase complexes, and identiﬁed the

GID4/ARMC8 and RanBP9/WDR26 modules responsible for sub-
strate recruitment (Mohamed et al, 2021 ; Sherpa et al, 2021 ).
Comprehensive phage display screens and peptide binding assays
demonstrated that human GID4 (hGID4) subunit binds a variety of
short motifs via a conserved pocket (Dong et al, 2020; Chrustowicz
et al, 2022). A chemical compound, PFI-7, blocks this binding pocket,
thereby preventing hGID4 interaction with Pro/N-terminal degron-
containing targets, such as DNA helicases DDX21 or DDX50 (Owens
et al, 2024). Likewise, degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
(HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase 1 (HMGCS1) requires a Pro/N-
degron motif and is regulated by mTORC1 activity (Yi et al, 2024).
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether hGID4 primarily recog-
nizes N-terminal degrons in vivo, since the GID4 substrate Zinc
ﬁnger MYND-type containing 19 (ZMYND19) lacks an N-terminus
compatible with the proposed consensus motif (Mohamed et al,
2021). Moreover, GID4 is not the only substrate receptor of the hGID
E3 ligase, as depletion of WDR26/Gid7, but not hGID4, stabilizes the
tumor suppressor HBP1 (Fig 1A)( Lampert et al, 2018; Mohamed et al,
2021). WDR26 also binds the metabolic enzyme NMNAT1 through an
internal basic degron motif, antagonized by YPEL5 (Gottemukkala
et al, 2024). Thus, the hGID complex may exploit multivalent binding
motifs to target substrates by binding to hGID4 and WDR26.
Although the structure and mechanisms of hGID E3 ligases are
beginning to emerge, its biological functions remain poorly un-
derstood. hGID activity has been implicated in regulating cell
proliferation, metabolism, embryonic development, and cell dif-
ferentiation. Mutations in WDR26 cause developmental disorders,
with altered expression levels in many invasive and metastatic
cancer cells (Ye et al, 2016). Interestingly, several hGID subunits
such as RanBP9, MKLN1, and WDR26 have been associated with cell
migration and adhesion (Maitland et al, 2022), but the underlying
substrates and mechanisms are unclear. Cell migration is a highly
integrated multistep process driven by spatiotemporal control of
membrane protrusions and actin polymerization at the leading
edge of the cell. Subsequent steps include adhesion to matrix
contacts, contraction of the cytoplasm, release from contact sites,
and recycling of membrane receptors from the rear to the front of
the cell. Actin dynamics are regulated by the activity of Rho GTPases
through the opposing actions of a large family of guanine nucle-
otide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins
(GAPs). RanBP9 interacts with ß-integrins and promotes cell at-
tachment and spreading (Woo et al, 2012), whereas MKLN1 and
WDR26 may alter the activity of Rho-type GTPases (Tripathi et al,
2015; Hasegawa et al, 2020). However, how hGID E3 ligase activity
controls Rho GTPases and inﬂuences cell migration and invasion
remains to be discovered.
Here, we employed an integrative approach combining cellular
phenotyping and systematic BioID2-based mass spectrometry to
uncover physiological hGID substrates involved in cell growth and
migration. Interestingly, ourﬁndings demonstrate that GID4 alters
cell migration by regulating RhoA activity, which is achieved
through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the RhoGAP
ARHGAP11A. Indeed, abrogation of GID4 expression or inhibition of
its substrate binding pocket leads to the accumulation of ARH-
GAP11A at the cell periphery and a decrease in RhoA activity.
Collectively, our study represents a valuable resource recapitu-
lating the transient interactome of GID4, altered by proteasomal
degradation and its substrate binding pocket. Among the inter-
actors, we validated the relationship between GID4 and ARHGAP11A,
which functions as a physiological substrate of the hGIDGID4 E3
ligase regulating cell growth and migration.
Results
GID4 is required for efﬁcient cell growth and migration
To investigate the role of the hGID E3 ligase and in particular its
substrate receptor GID4 in regulating cell growth and proliferation,
we generated stable, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible GID4 KD HeLa and
RPE1 cell lines using the CRISPR-Bac system (Schertzer et al, 2019).
Brieﬂy, HeLa or RPE1 cells were transfected with a pool of four
single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting theGid4 gene or without a
sgRNA for control (sgControl). Stable integration of the sgRNA and
DOX-inducible PB_tre_Cas9 vector was selected using G418 and
hygromycin for HeLa, or G418 and puromycin for RPE1 cells. In-
dependent clones were expanded, and efﬁcient GID4 KD was
conﬁrmed by immunoblotting after DOX induction for 96 h. For both
the HeLa and RPE1 cell lines, two validated clones termed sgGID4 KD
#1 and sgGID4 KD #2 were further characterized and used
throughout this study. Importantly, although GID4 was efﬁciently
depleted, WDR26 levels remained unchanged for both the HeLa and
RPE1 cell lines, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the sgGID4 and stability
of the remaining hGID complex (Figs 1Band S1A). We also used the
recently described GID4-inhibitor PFI-7, which binds to a struc-
turally deﬁned GID4 pocket, thereby blocking access of N-terminal
degron motifs (Owens et al, 2024). Compared with DMSO controls,
the addition of PFI-7 to sgControl HeLa or RPE-1 cells did not alter
GID4 or WDR26 levels, respectively (Figs 1B and S1A).
To uncover cellular functions of the hGIDGID4 complex, we ﬁrst
tested whether GID4 depletion affects proliferation of HeLa cells.
Interestingly, cell lines lacking GID4 or treated with the GID4 in-
hibitor PFI-7 showed approximately twofold reduced growth rates
compared with control cells or DMSO alone, as measured by MTT
absorbance at 570 nm (Figs 1Cand S1B). The addition of the PFI-7
compound to GID4-depleted cell lines did not further enhance this
proliferation defect, conﬁrming that PFI-7 is speciﬁc and GID4 is the
relevant PFI-7 target underlying this phenotype. To conﬁrm and
extend these results, we performed wound healing assays to ex-
amine GID4 function in directed cell migration. We observed more
than sixfold delay of both sgGID4 KD #1 and sgGID4 KD #2 HeLa cells
to close the cell-free area compared with sgControl (Figs 1Dand
S2A). The wound area of PFI-7–treated sgControl HeLa cells was
approximately fourfold larger than sgControl cells treated with
DMSO (Fig 1D). The wound healing response of PFI-7–treated cells
was less pronounced compared with both sgGID4 KD #1 and sgGID4
KD #2 cell lines, whereas PFI-7 addition to GID4-depleted cells did
not enhance the phenotype (Figs 1Dand S2A). Importantly, the re-
expression of GID4 in sgGID4 KD #1 HeLa cells (+GID4) restored the
gap closure to levels similar to those of control cells, conﬁrming
that the observed wound healing defect is caused by the lack of
GID4 and not an unspeciﬁc off-target effect or compensatory
mechanism (Figs 1D, S1C, and S2A).

Delayed wound closure could be a consequence of reduced
proliferation or a combination of reduced proliferation and im-
paired cell migration. To investigate whether decreased cell mi-
gration may contribute to the wound healing defect, we carried out
single-cell tracking assays. We used RPE1 cells for this analysis
because they exhibit higher random migration than HeLa cells and
are thus better suited for velocity measurements. Interestingly, we
observed that GID4-depleted RPE1 cells display more than twofold
decreased velocity compared with sgControl cells (Figs 1Eand S2B
and C), and this defect was restored upon the re-expression of GID4
(Figs 1E, S1D, andS2B and C). Likewise, PFI-7–treated sgControl cells
also showed reduced velocity compared with DMSO-treated
sgControls, albeit a less pronounced reduction than observed
with untreated or PFI-7–treated sgGID4 KD cells. Taken together, we
conclude that GID4 is required for efﬁcient cell motility, suggesting
the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase complex regulates targets speciﬁcally in-
volved in this process.
BioID2-mediated proximity labeling identiﬁes potential
GID4 substrates
To decipher the GID4 proximal protein interaction network and
explore potential GID4 substrates regulating cell migration and
other biological functions, we carried out a proximity-dependent
biotinylation screen (Fig 2A). To achieve this goal, weﬁrst generated
stable Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells expressing a BirA2-Flag-GID4 fusion
protein (BioID2-GID4) in a tetracycline-inducible manner. For
control, we produced Flp-In T-REx HeLa cell lines expressing BirA2-
Flag-EGFP (BioID2-GFP). To distinguish potential substrates from
general interactors or regulatory proteins, we generated a BirA2-
Flag-GID4E237A fusion cell line (BioID2-GID4E237A), harboring a spe-
ciﬁc point mutation known to abolish substrate binding (Dong et al,
2018). We also constructed Flp-In T-REx HeLa cell lines expressing
WDR26-BirA2-Flag (WDR26-BioID2) as an additional bait to select
substrates primarily recruited via the GID4 substrate receptor.
Immunoblotting with FLAG antibodies conﬁrmed that the BioID2-
GID4 or BioID2-GID4E237A proteins are expressed at comparable
levels, over twofold higher than endogenous GID4, making it un-
likely that endogenous GID4 prevents their assembly into the hGID
complex (Fig S3C). Indeed, both fusion proteins stably assemble
into hGID complexes as measured by co-immunoprecipitation with
the hGID catalytic subunit MAEA (Fig S3A). Importantly, treatment of
the BioID2-GID4 and BioID2-GID4E237A cell lines with tetracycline and
biotin demonstrated that both fusion proteins efﬁciently trigger
biotinylation of endogenous proteins in their vicinity (Fig S3B).
Likewise, the WDR26-BioID2 fusion showed appropriate protein
expression and biotinylation, and co-immunoprecipitated with the
hGID catalytic subunit MAEA (Fig S3D and E).
To identify proximal candidate substrates of GID4, we next incu-
bated the cell lines with tetracycline and biotin for 24 h and afﬁnity-
isolated biotinylated proteins fromcell extracts using Streptavidin
beads. Biotinylated proteins were digested on beads, identiﬁed by
mass spectrometry (MS), and quantiﬁed by spectral counts. We further
used the SAINT algorithm (Choi et al, 2011) comparing intensity of
proteins at different conditions versus experimental controls. To
distinguish substrates from other hGID4-interacting proteins, we
performed BioID2 assays in cells treated or not with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 (Fig 2A). As expected, we successfully recovered all
known hGID subunits with BioID2-GID4, BioID2-GID4E237A,a n dM G 1 3 2 -
treated BioID2-GID4 baits (Fig 2B and Cand Table S1), conﬁrming that
GID4 engages with the hGID complex independently of proteasome
function or substrate binding. In addition to the hGID complex
subunits, the analysis of the generated protein network showed
functionally associated protein clusters (Fig 2C). These components
are implicated in diverse cellular functions including mRNA degra-
dation, the ISWI-type and BRK domain complexes, integrator and
mitochondrial activity, mitotic spindle assembly, low-density lipo-
protein particle receptor binding, and the cellular response to hy-
droperoxide. Further work is required to functionally validate these
interactors, which may regulate E3 ligase activity and/or recruit the
hGID complex to speciﬁc subcellular locations.
Next, we extended our search for proteins that exhibit degra-
dation substrate behavior by focusing on GID4-interacting proteins
that are signiﬁcantly enriched in MG132-treated BioID2-GID4 cells,
but not in untreated GID4 or MG132-treated BioID2-GID4E237A con-
trols. To further show GID4 speciﬁcity, we also included WDR26-
BioID2 in this analysis. We identiﬁed 41 proteins with high conﬁ-
dence scores (Bayesian False Discovery Rate [BFDR]≤ 0.01) that are
specially enriched in MG132-treated GID4, but not in the other
BioID2 baits (Fig 2D and Table S2). Network analysis revealed that
sgControl treated with DMSO (10μM), sgControl treated with PFI-7 (10μM), sgGID4 KD #1 treated with PFI-7 (10μM), and sgGID4 KD #2 treated with PFI-7 (10μM). Blots were

Figure 2. Proximity labeling by BioID2 identiﬁes GID4 degradation substrate candidates.
(A) Workﬂow of the BioID2 pipeline to identify GID4 interactors and putative substrates. Flp-In T-REx HeLa cell lines expressing either BirA2-Flag-GID4 (BioID2-GID4),
BirA2-Flag-GID4E237A (BioID2-GID4E237A), or BirA2-Flag-EGFP (BioID2-GFP) as bait proteins were treated with tetracycline (1μg/ml) and biotin (50μM) in the presence or
absence of MG132 (5μM). Biotinylated proteins were isolated on streptavidin beads and digested by trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The

these proteins are functionally linked to DNA replication and
chromatin remodeling, RhoGAP signaling and microtubule cyto-
skeleton, nuclear pore assembly, cellular senescence, and sister
chromatid cohesion (Fig 2E), implicating potential roles of GID4-
dependent degradation in these processes. Although the previ-
ously reported GID4 substrate ZMYND19 was not identiﬁed with
BioID2-GID4, the ZMYND19 interaction was speciﬁcally recovered in
MG132-treated ARMC8-BioID2, but not WDR26-BioID2 screens (Fig
S3Fand Table S3), conﬁrming binding speciﬁcity of ZMYND19 toward
the GID4-ARMC8 substrate module.
Taken together, this comprehensive BioID2 analysis identi-
ﬁed numerous GID4 interactors that (1) are known hGID sub-
units or potential regulatory proteins, or (2) exhibit degradation
substrate–like behavior, where their interaction is increased in the
presence of MG132. Overall, this approach identi ﬁed 507 GID4
interactors with high con ﬁdence scores (BFDR ≤ 0.01), encom-
passing both previously reported interactors (Fig S3G)( Owens et al,
2024) and numerous additional candidates.
ARHGAP11A is ubiquitinated and degraded by a GID4-dependent
mechanism
Because we discovered that GID4 is required for cell migration,
we next tested whether components of the identi ﬁed RhoGAP
signaling complex are degraded in vivo in a GID4-dependent
manner. Of those, ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1 are GAPs that are
known to regulate cell migration via RhoA or Rac1, respectively
(J a c q u e m e te ta l ,2 0 1 3; Kagawa et al, 2013). To investigate whether
GID4 is required to degrade ARHGAP11A, RACGAP1, and KIFC1, we
treated HeLa sgGID4 KD or sgControl cell lines with the trans-
lation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and assessed their half-life
by immunoblotting (Fig 3A ). Interestingly, although all three
proteins are degraded with a half-life below 4 h, only ARHGAP11A
w a ss t a b i l i z e di nt h ea b s e n c eo fG I D 4(Fig 3A). A previous study
reported that RACGAP1 and KIFC1 are degraded by the anaphase-
promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase,
thereby regulating mitotic spindle disassembly and cell
spreading (Min et al, 2014). We thus speculate that APC/C may
explain the remaining, GID4-independent degradation of ARH-
GAP11A. To corroborate these data, we analyzed ARHGAP11A and
KIFC1 levels in CHX-treated HeLa sgGID4 KD or sgControl cell lines
that were also treated with PFI-7 or DMSO. Indeed, ARHGAP11A,
but not KIFC1, was stabilized in the presence of PFI-7, implying
that a functional GID4 substrate binding pocket is required for
ARHGAP11A degradation in vivo (Fig 3B). To further validate this
result, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged WT GID4 or its E237A
mutant and probed for co-immunoprecipitation of ARHGAP11A,
KIFC1, or the hGID catalytic subunit MAEA as a positive control
(Fig 3C). We also tested whether their binding is altered by the
PFI-7 inhibitor. Indeed, both ARHGAP11A and KIFC1 readily co-
immunoprecipitated with GID4in a PFI-7-dependent manner,
a n dt h e i ri n t e r a c t i o nw i t ht h eG I D 4E237A mutant was signi ﬁ-
cantly diminished. Moreover, they failed to bind FLAG-tagged
WDR26, suggesting that ARHGAP11A engages the hGID com-
plex via GID4, and not the alternate WDR26 substrate receptor
(Fig 3C).
To examine whether ARHGAP11A is ubiquitinated by hGIDGID4,
we immunoprecipitated FLAG-t agged ARHGAP11A from MG132-
treated HeLa cells overexpressing HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub)
and either Myc-tagged GID4E237A or WT GID4 treated with DMSO or
PFI-7 to block substrate binding (Fig 3D). For further control, we
overexpressed Myc-tagged WDR26. Indeed, immunoprecipitation
of HA-Ub or FLAG-tagged ARHGAP11A revealed a smear of high
molecular weight species, consistent with ubiquitinated ARH-
GAP11A (Fig 3D ). Although we cannot rigorously exclude that
additional E3 ligases may contribute to this activity, ARHGAP11A
polyubiquitination was inhibited by the addition of PFI-7 and
absent when analyzing the GID4-E237A mutation. Moreover, no
ubiquitination of ARHGAP11A was observed in cells overexpressing
Myc-tagged WDR26. Taken together, these results suggest that the
hGIDGID4 E3 ligase directly ubiquitinates ARHGAP11A, which in turn
targets this RhoA GAP for rapid degradation by the 26S
proteasome.
ARHGAP11A is targeted by GID4 through a non–N-terminal degron
To further conﬁrm that ARHGAP11A is speciﬁcally targeted by the
GID4-ARMC8 and not the WDR26-RANBP9 substrate module, we
depleted endogenous GID4, WDR26, ARMC8, or RANBP9 by siRNA (Fig
4A). Indeed, in contrast to WDR26 or RANBP9, RNAi depletion of GID4
and ARMC8 leads to the accumulation of ARHGAP11A, but not HBP1,
in HeLa cells. Conversely, RNAi KD of WDR26 and RANBP9 triggered
accumulation of HBP1, whereas ARHGAP11A levels were unaffected.
Together, these results demonstrate that the steady-state levels of
ARHGAP11A are speciﬁcally regulated by the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase
complex.
Because ARHGAP11A interacted with GID4 by a pocket-dependent
mechanism, we next tested the putative involvement of its
N-terminal degron. ARHGAP11A exists in three different isoforms.
Interestingly, isoforms 1 and 2 encompass a putative N-terminal
non-proline degron motif (WDQRLVRL) that is absent in isoform 3
(Fig 4B). To investigate whether this distinct N-terminal motif
schematic drawing was adapted fromGingras et al (2019), and is created withBioRender.com. (B) (Upper panel) Dot plots of quantiﬁed BioID2-interacting proteins

regulates GID4-dependent degradation, we compared the half-lives
of C-terminally Flag-tagged isoforms 1 (ARHGAP11Aiso1-Flag) and 3
(ARHGAP11Aiso3-Flag) in HeLa cells treated with either siScrambled
or siGID4 (Fig 4C and D). Surprisingly, both ARHGAP11Aiso1-Flag and
ARHGAP11Aiso3-Flag fusion proteins were rapidly degraded in the
presence of GID4 but stabilized after GID4 RNAi depletion. This
suggests that the N-terminal motif of ARHGAP11A is not required for
GID4-dependent degradation in vivo, implying the existence of
alternative binding motifs. Consistent with this notion, analysis of
the N-termini of all substrate candidates binding GID4 in a pocket-
dependent manner in which spectral counts increased upon MG132
treatment revealed no coherent sequence logo that aligns with
the previously reported N-terminal consensus degron (Fig S3H)
(Chrustowicz et al, 2022).
To directly determine binding of GID4 to putative degron motifs
of ARHGAP11A, we usedﬂuorescence polarization (FP) to measure
the af ﬁnity of TAMRA-labeled peptides to recombinant GID4
lacking its N-terminal domain (GID4Δ1–115). Although the control
peptide PGLWKS bound with the expected afﬁnity of 2.4 μM, the
WDQRLV peptide encompassing the amino terminus of ARHGA-
P11Aiso1 was unable to interact with measurable afﬁnity (Fig 4E). To
exclude that the TAMRA label interferes with binding, we devised
an in vitro competition assay, where the GID4Δ1–115-bound TAMRA-
labeled control peptide was competed with increasing concen-
trations of unlabeled peptides covering different regions of
ARHGAP11A (Fig 4E). In contrast to controls, peptides covering the
N-terminal sequences of the two ARHGAP11A isoforms showed no
binding activity with biologically relevant afﬁnity. Similar results
were obtained when titrating a peptide corresponding to the
C-terminus of ARHGAP11A, or a peptide covering a recently de-
scribed putative internal degron (Fig 4E)( Zhang et al, 2023). We
conclude that GID4 recognizes ARHGAP11A by an unknown
mechanism that requires its substrate binding pocket, possibly by
using an internal or non-linear degron motif or by exploiting
multiple low-afﬁnity degrons that may cooperate to allow efﬁcient
recruitment into the hGID complex. Alternatively, we cannot ex-
clude that binding of ARHGAP11A and GID4 is bridged by an un-
known component.
GID4-dependent degradation of ARHGAP11A regulates
cell migration
If hGIDGID4 activity alters cell migration by increasing ARHGAP11A
turnover, we predict that decreasing ARHGAP11A levels by RNAi
may restore the observed wound healing and motility defects.
Consistent with previous results (Lawson et al, 2016; Dai et al,
2018), ARHGAP11A-depleted HeLa and RPE1 cells displayed
profound migration defects, as determined by wound healing
assays and single-cell velocity measurements (Figs 5B and Cand
S4B). These results imply that both reduced and increased
ARHGAP11A levels cause defects in cell migration and motility,
characteristic of altered GTPase dynamics. Therefore, RNAi de-
pletion and GID4-dependent degradation of ARHGAP11A may
antagonize each other. Indeed, ARHGAP11A steady-state levels
were partially re-established in RNAi-depleted HeLa or RPE1
cells treated with PFI-7 inhibitor (Figs 5A and S4A), and this
increase was sufﬁcient to restore the wound healing and velocity
defects compared with ARHGAP11A RNAi solvent controls (DMSO)
(Figs 5B and C and S4B). Together, these data con ﬁrm that
ARHGAP11A turnover is regulated by hGID GID4 E3 ligase activity
and that increased ARHGAP11A levels lead to cell migration
defects.
Decreased hGIDGID4 activity down-regulates spatiotemporal
dynamics of RhoA
We next used immunoﬂuorescence to examine the subcellular
localization of endogenous ARHGAP11A in HeLa cells in the pres-
ence or absence of hGIDGID4 activity. Consistent with previous re-
sults (Namba et al, 2020), ARHGAP11A localized to the cytoplasm and
accumulated in nucleoli in sgControl cells (Fig 6A). siRNA depletion
or omission of the secondary antibody abolished this staining (Figs
6A and S5A), demonstrating speciﬁcity of the assay. Interestingly,
ARHGAP11A levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm increased upon
PFI-7 treatment, and a fraction of ARHGAP11A accumulated at the
cell periphery (Fig 6A).
Because ARHGAP11A is as a RhoA GAP (Kagawa et al, 2013; Xu
et al, 2013), we assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA
activity in live cells lacking functional hGIDGID4. To this end, we
took advantage of the previously described RhoA second-
generation biosensor (RhoA2G) FRET system (Fritz et al, 2013 ),
and generated HeLa cell lines stably expressing RhoA2G (referred
to as RhoA2G-HeLa). In addition, we employed the established
RhoA2G-REF52 cell lines, as REF52ﬁbroblasts display more pro-
nounced cytoskeletal migratory phenotypes (Martin et al, 2016).
Importantly, siRNA-mediated GID4 KD decreased the FRET ratio in
both RhoA2G-HeLa and RhoA2G-REF52 cells (Figs 6B and Cand S5B
and C), implying decreased RhoA activity. Similarly, RhoA activity
was signiﬁcantly decreased after 6 or 12 h of PFI-7 treatment in
RhoA2G-HeLa or RhoA2G-REF52 cells compared with DMSO con-
trols (Figs 6Dand S5D). RhoA inhibition in the absence of hGIDGID4
was uniform over the cell periphery, consistent with the observed

hyperactivation and inactivation of RhoA lead to cell migration

maintain physiological levels of ARHGAP11A and ensure spatio-
temporal RhoA activity during cell migration.

GID4 degrades ARHGAP11A for migration Bagci et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202403046 vol 7 | no 12 | e202403046 11 of 21
Discussion
Here, we show that the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase regulates cell growth and
migration, and we validated the RhoGAP ARHGAP11A as a physio-
logical substrate. Indeed, ARHGAP11A is stabilized and accumulates
at the cell periphery in cells with reduced GID4 levels and/or ac-
tivity, leading to low RhoA-GTP levels and cell migration defects.
Moreover, our BioID2 approach identiﬁed additional GID4 inter-
actors, among them, substrate candidates that depend on a
conserved substrate binding pocket. Together, these results expand
the cellular functions of hGID E3 ligase complexes and identify
physiological substrates and mechanisms underlying GID4-speciﬁc
phenotypes.
BioID2 analysis identiﬁed hGID subunits, potential regulators,
and putative GID4 substrates
Our comprehensive BioID2 screen identiﬁed 507 GID4 interactors
with high conﬁdence scores (BFDR≤ 0.01), which we divided into
substrate candidates and GID4 interactors that may rather function
as hGID subunits or regulators. Indeed, we detected all known hGID
subunits, including RANBP9, RANBP10, and MKLN1, which bind the
hGID complex by a mutually exclusive mechanism. Among the
additional hGID interactors, we note HTRA2, which was previously
shown by AP-MS analysis to interact with several GID subunits
(Table S1) (Lampert et al, 2018) and bind the giant E3 ligase BIRC6
(Ehrmann et al, 2023). In contrast, we did notﬁnd a human ho-
mologue of GID12, a GID4-interacting protein that sterically blocks
substrate ubiquitination (Qiao et al, 2022). Many of these pocket-
independent interactors are nuclear proteins involved in regulation
of gene expression or cell division (Baillat et al, 2005;Du et al, 2021;
Nakanishi, 2022) and may thus help recruiting the hGID complex to
regulate DNA-associated processes, polymerase activity, and/or
cell cycle progression. Further work is required to validate these
candidates, for example, by extending the BioID approach to other
hGID core subunits.
Importantly, we also identiﬁed over 30 GID4 substrate candi-
dates, as deﬁned by an increased spectral count upon MG132
treatment and dependence on a functional GID4 substrate binding
pocket. Moreover, these interactors do not bind WDR26, suggesting
that they are speciﬁc to GID4. Many of these identiﬁed GID4 substrate
candidates are involved in chromatin organization, chromosome
segregation and cell division, DNA binding and RNA processing, and
gene expression (Fig 2E), consistent with the predominantly nuclear
localization of GID4. For example, we found that GID4 interacts with
the Rb transcriptional corepressor 1 (RBL1), the MAU2 sister chro-
matid cohesion factor and the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and the
transcription factor ZNF106, which has been implicated in growth-
related metabolism associated with early multiple organ failure in
acute pancreatitis (Ciosk et al, 2000; Grasberger et al, 2005; Henley &
Dick, 2012; Liu & Dekker, 2022; van den Berg et al, 2022). Moreover, GID4
interacts with the ribosome biogenesis regulator BYSL (Table S2)
(Adachi et al, 2007; Fukuda et al, 2008), suggesting that the hGIDGID4 E3
ligase may regulate ribosome abundance.
A recent study identiﬁed HMGCS1 as a Pro/N-degron–containing
GID4 substrate that is targeted for degradation in vivo (Yi et al,
2024). Indeed, HMGCS1 is stabilized in cells lacking GID4, MAEA or
MKLN1, or both RMND5A and RMND5B subunits. HMGCS1 undergoes
direct ubiquitination in vitro only in the presence of GID4 and
interacts with GID4 via its N-terminal proline (Yi et al, 2024). In
contrast, our previous work revealed that GID4 can also recognize
substrates that do not follow the N-terminal degron rule, as we
showed that ZMYND19 lacks such a motif but nevertheless interacts
and is ubiquitinated in vitro in a GID4-dependent manner
(Mohamed et al, 2021). Although the BioID2-GID4 screens did not
contain ZMYND19, it interacts with ARMC8-BioID2 in MG132-treated
cells, conﬁrming its speciﬁcity toward the GID4-ARMC8 substrate
receptor module. Interestingly, only a fraction of the putative GID4
substrates contain distinct N-terminal motifs that fulﬁll the

stringent criteria proposed as degrons by earlier studies. It is
possible that some of the pocket-dependent GID4-interactors bind
indirectly, or the N-terminal degron may be insufﬁcient to mediate
binding to GID4.
We included MG132 enrichment as a substrate criterion and thus
ﬁltered out GID4 binding proteins whose protein levels are not
altered in the absence of GID4. For example, previous work revealed
that GID4 binds several nucleolar RNA helicases including DDX17,
DDX21, and DDX50 (Owens et al, 2024). Although these targets rely on
an N-terminal degron motif, their ubiquitination does not lead to
proteasomal degradation. Thus, the hGIDGID4 complex may regulate
cellular processes by degradative and non-degradative functions,
and future work is needed to understand their selective ubiq-
uitination mechanism. We also note that we recovered signiﬁcantly
more BioID2-GID4 interactors in Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells (Fig S3G)
compared with a similar study (Owens et al, 2024). This might in part
be due to our MG132 treatment identifying additional interactors
and/or better incorporation of our BioID2-GID4 fusion protein into
the hGID complex, as we successfully identiﬁed all known hGID
subunits in both untreated and MG132-treated BioID2-GID4
samples.
The hGIDGID4 E3 ligase regulates cell migration by degrading
ARHGAP11A
Our phenotypic analysis demonstrates that the hGIDGID4 E3 ligase
complex is required for cell growth and migration in multiple cell
models (Woo et al, 2012; Tripathi et al, 2015; Ye et al, 2016; Hasegawa
et al, 2020; Maitland et al, 2022). Indeed, loss of GID4 or inhibition of
its binding pocket signiﬁcantly impairs the wound healing response
in HeLa cells and alters the motility of single RPE1 cells. Inter-
estingly, we found that this defect is caused by GID4 interacting via
its conserved substrate pocket with a cluster of proteins associated
with cytoskeleton organization, including the two Rho GTPase –
activating enzymes (RhoGAPs) ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1. Although
ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1 are both turned over with a half-life of
less than 4 h, only ARHGAP11A is stabilized in the absence of GID4
or upon PFI-7 treatment. Indeed, RACGAP1 is targeted for protea-
somal degradation in vivo by the APC/C E3 ligase (Min et al,
2014). Interestingly, our results demonstrate that GID4-dependent
degradation of ARHGAP11A does not require an N-terminal degron
sequence, suggesting the existence of an alternative binding
mechanism. First, although the known substrate cleft of GID4 is rather
narrow, ARHGAP11A may bind to GID4 via an internal degron, perhaps
involving alternative GID4 binding sites. Second, the GID4-ARHGAP11A
interaction may be indirect and bridged by an unknown protein
containing an N-terminal degron. Finally, the turnover of ARHGAP11A
could be a secondary effect of GID4 activity, potentially involving the
degradation of another substrate that enhances ARHGAP11A ubiq-
uitination. Further investigation is needed to reveal the molecular
basis of ARHGAP11A’s interaction with GID4.
ARHGAP11A targets RhoA involved in cytoskeletal organization,
thereby regulating cell division, lymphocyte activation, myeloid
leukocyte differentiation, and leukocyte apoptosis (Lawson & Der,
2018). ARHGAP11A also regulates cell cycle progression by a RhoA-
independent mechanism, as its depletion leads to cell cycle defects
with high p27 levels (Lawson et al, 2016). Surprisingly, ARHGAP11A is
enriched in nucleoli (Zanin et al, 2013; Namba et al, 2020), with
unclear functional implications. However, our results demonstrate
that ARHGAP11A accumulates at the periphery of cells lacking GID4
activity, without apparent asymmetric localization and polarization.
Consistent with previous results (Kagawa et al, 2013; Zanin et al, 2013;
Lawson & Der, 2018 ), increased ARHGAP11A steady-state levels
globally decrease RhoA-GTP, resulting in cell migration and motility
defects. Conversely, ARHGAP11A depletion reduces cell proliferation
and cell migration (Dai et al, 2018; Guan et al, 2021) by increasing RhoA
activity. Thus, both too much and too little RhoA activity interfere with
cell motility and migration, consistent with the widespread spatio-
temporal regulation of GTPases required to organize polarized actin
structures and membrane protrusions. Indeed, GID4 inhibition by
PFI-7 in ARHGAP11A-depleted cells allows re-activation of RhoA-GTP
and consequently cell motility by partially restoring ARHGAP11A
protein levels. The hGIDGID4 E3 ligase thus antagonizes ARHGAP11A
in vivo, thereby setting a threshold for RhoA activation.
GID4-mediated ARHGAP11A stabilization at the cell periphery
might regulate RhoA activity in different ways. For example, low
RhoA activity might impair leading edge protrusion/retraction
cycles that contribute to both random and directed motility. This
is especially relevant in REF52ﬁbroblasts, where RhoA activity is
required for generating actomyosin contractility necessary for la-
mella formation and efﬁcient leading edge protrusion and re-
traction (Martin et al, 2016). Alternatively, lower RhoA activity may
globally impair actomyosin contractility. Future studies should
address how subtle RhoA activity dynamics in GID4- or ARHGAP11A-
perturbed cells are propagated at the whole-cell level to impair
random and directed motility.
Irrespective of the detailed mechanism, our results demonstrate
that hGIDGID4 regulates RhoA activity through ARHGAP11A and imply
that ARHGAP11A steady-state levels need to be carefully balanced
to allow directed cell migration. Although the regulatory mecha-
nisms controlling GID4-mediated ARHGAP11A degradation under
physiological conditions remain to be examined, we note that
ARHGAP11A expression is increased in various cancers, including
hepatocellular and clear cell renal carcinoma and gastric cancer.
Moreover, elevated ARHGAP11A levels have been associated with
poor survival (Dai et al, 2018; Fan et al, 2021; Yang et al, 2023). It is
thus tempting to speculate that loss of GID4 stabilizes ARHGAP11A in
these cancer cells, thereby contributing to tumor progression.
BioID: a valid approach to identify E3 ligase substrates and
functions
The identiﬁcation of physiological E3 ligase substrates is often
hampered by the generally low afﬁnity of substrate–receptor in-
teractions that cannot easily withstand cell lysis and stringent
immunoprecipitation conditions. To circumvent this bottleneck,
BioID screening emerged as an alternative approach, as bio-
tinylation of interacting proteins is dictated by their close proximity
in cells before lysis and extract preparation (Roux et al, 2012). Until
recently, BioID approaches suffered from severe speciﬁcity limi-
tations, fueled by the need to overexpress bulky fusion proteins
combined with long incubation times to reach sufﬁcient labeling.
However, the recent development of smaller biotinylation enzyme
GID4 degrades ARHGAP11A for migration Bagci et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202403046 vol 7 | no 12 | e202403046 13 of 21
variants with increased catalytic activity (e.g., miniTurboID, UltraID)
mitigated some of these risks (Branon et al, 2018; Kubitz et al, 2022).
Nevertheless, including secondary ﬁltering criteria such as the
presence of motifs and/or domains, or stringent speciﬁcity controls
such as treatment with MG132 substantially improves the identi-
ﬁcation of high conﬁdence interactors. Ideally, inhibitory com-
pounds or mutant proteins altering binding to critical components,
for example, mutations in the substrate interaction domain, further
help to distinguish direct from indirect, unspeciﬁc interactors. In
addition, rapid improvements in AlphaFold to predict binding
surfaces with atomic accuracy using a deep learning algorithm
greatly facilitate the identiﬁcation of critical residues (Jumper et al,
2021). As shown by this and other studies (Shariﬁ Tabar et al, 2022),
including such speciﬁcity criteria allows for efﬁcient ﬁltering of
comprehensive BioID datasets, making this approach comple-
mentary to other proteomics approaches such as AP-MS and diGly
enrichment (Iconomou & Saunders, 2016). Therefore, advanced
BioID screening strategies hold great potential to study other multi-
subunit RING domain–containing E3 ligases, particularly those for
which physiological substrates remain scarce despite known
substrate receptors and/or functions.
Materials and Methods
Reagents and tools
Cell lines, plasmids, antibodies, oligonucleotides, chemicals and
other reagents, and software used in this study are listed in Tables
S4 and S5.
Cell culture, siRNA transfections, and generation of stable Flp-In
T-REx cell lines
Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (DMEM/FBS/PS) and maintained at 37°C in
5% CO2. For siRNA transfections, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA
reagents targeting speciﬁc human (Gid4, Wdr26, Armc8, Ranbp9,
Arhgap11a) or rat (Gid4) genes, or non-targeting control (siS-
crambled) were transfected in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000
or RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Stable Flp-In T-REx HeLa cell lines expressing BirA2-Flag-GID4,
BirA2-Flag-GID4E237A, WDR26-BirA2-Flag, ARMC8-BirA2-Flag, BirA2-
Flag-EGFP, Flag-GID4, Flag-GID4E237A, WDR26-Flag, Flag-EGFP, ARH-
GAP11Aiso1-Flag, ARHGAP11A iso3-Flag, or an empty vector were
generated as described elsewhere (Kean et al, 2012; Bagci et al,
2020). Protein expression and biotinylation were induced in the
presence of 1μg/ml tetracycline and 50μM biotin.
Generation of CRISPR/BAC GID4 KD HeLa or RPE1 cell lines
The CRISPR-Bac cells were generated as described elsewhere, with
modiﬁcations (Schertzer et al, 2019). We designed four sgRNAs tar-
geting different exons of theGid4 gene. Each sgRNA was separately
cloned into the PB_rtTA_BsmBI vector to generate the following
vectors: PB_rtTA_Bsmb1_Gid4_sgRNA1, PB_rtTA_Bsmb1_Gid4_sgRNA2,
PB_rtTA_Bsmb1_Gid4_sgRNA3 and PB_rtTA_Bsmb1_Gid4_sgRNA4. As
RPE1 cells are resistant to hygromycin B, the hygromycin B resistance
(HygR) gene in the PB_tre_Cas9 vector was replaced with a puromycin
resistance (PuroR) gene using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly kit to
generate the PB_tre_Cas9_puro vector. The HiFi reaction was per-
formed according to the manufacturer’sr e c o m m e n d a t i o n s .W e
then simultaneously cotransfected 625 ng of either PB_tre_Cas9
(containing HygR) or PB_tre_Cas9_puro (containing PuroR) with
1,250 ng of the Super piggyBac Transposase expression vector and
157 ng of each of the four PB_rtTA_BsmBI vectors with sgRNAs tar-
geting theGid4 gene. As a negative control, we cotransfected the
empty pb_rtTA_Bsmb1 vector into which we did not clone a sgRNA-
targeting sequence (control). HeLa cells were selected in the presence
of hygromycin B (200μg/ml) and G418 (200μg/ml) for 10 d. RPE1 cells
were selected in the presence of puromycin (10μg/ml) and G418
(200 μg/ml) for 10–20 d. Cell death was observed within 3 or 4 d upon
G418 and hygromycin B or puromycin treatment. Isolated clones were
trypsinized, pooled together, and plated into new 10-cm plates in
fresh selection medium to generate stable CRISPR/BAC GID4 KD HeLa
or RPE1 cell lines. After selection, cells were cultured in the absence of
G 4 1 8a n dh y g r o m y c i nBo rp u r o m y c i n ,a n dD O X( 1μg/ml) was added to
the DMEM/FBS/PS medium for 4 d to induce the Cas9 expression. The
efﬁciency of GID4 KD was assessed by Western blot.
MTT assay
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assays were carried out as described elsewhere, with modiﬁ-
cations (Stier et al, 2023). The MTT assay kit (Promega) was used to
measure cell proliferation according to the manufacturer’sr e c o m -
mendations. 5,000 HeLa cells were pl a t e di n9 6 - w e l lp l a t e sw i t ht h r e e
biological replicates per condition. Cells were grown in 96-well plates
f o r2 4 ,4 8 ,o r7 2hb e f o r et h ei n c u b a t i o nw i t ht h eM T Td y em a s t e rm i xf o r
2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. The reaction was stopped by adding 100μls t o p
solution. Plates containing the MTT-treated cells were measured at a
wavelength of 570 nm, and the growth rate was normalized to day 0.
Wound healing
Two-well silicone inserts with a deﬁned cell-free gap (ibidi) were
inserted into eight-well microscopy slides (ibidi). For each condition,
10,000 HeLa sgControl, sgGID4 KD #1, or sgGID4 #2 cells, untreated or
treated with DMSO (10μM) or PFI-7 (10μM), from the experiments as
in (Figs 1Dand S2A) were plated into each chamber and incubated
overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of DMSO
(10 μM) or PFI-7 (10μM). For the GID4 rescue assay, untransfected
sgControl, sgGID4 KD #1 transfected with an empty vector, or sgGID4
KD #1 cells transfected with an untagged GID4-expressing plasmid
were plated into chambers after 24 h of Lipofectamine 2000 trans-
fection (Fig 1D). For siRNA transfections, siScrambled, siARHGAP11A, or
siARHGAP11A-transfected cells, untreated or treated with PFI-7
(10μM), were plated into chambers after 24 h of siRNA transfec-
tions (Fig 5B). The next day, the medium was replaced with or without
DMSO (10μM) or PFI-7 (10μM )a n dp l a c e di n s i d et h eC O2 incubator of
a phase-contrast microscope. Time-lapse imaging was performed by
taking an image every 1 h for 24 h using a 10X objective. Three random
ﬁelds were acquired for each of the three biological replicates. The
GID4 degrades ARHGAP11A for migration Bagci et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202403046 vol 7 | no 12 | e202403046 14 of 21
Nikon Ti2-E wideﬁeld microscope equipped with a xy stage (Prior), a
piezo z-drive (Prior), and NIS-Elements software was used to take
images. Captured images were analyzed using ImageJ software. The
size of the gap area at times 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 h was measured using
the freehand selection tool and analyzed using the Measure com-
mand in the Analyze menu. The measured gap area at times 5, 10, 15,
or 20 h was normalized to 0 h, to determine the wound area closure in
relative units.
Single-cell tracking
Single-cell tracking was performed and analyzed as described
elsewhere, with modiﬁcations (Pijuan et al, 2019). 5,000 RPE1 cells per
condition were plated into eight-well microscopy slides (ibidi) and
incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of
DMSO (10μM) or PFI-7 (10μM). Like wound healing assays, sgControl,
sgGID4 KD #1, or sgGID4 #2 cells, untreated or treated with DMSO
(10μM) or PFI-7 (10μM), from experiments as inFigs 1Eand S2B and C
were plated into eight wells. For the GID4 rescue assay, untransfected
sgControl, sgGID4 KD #1 transfected with an empty vector, or sgGID4
KD #1 cells transfected with an untagged GID4-expressing plasmid
were plated into eight wells after 24 h of Lipofectamine 2000
transfection (Figs 1E and S2B and C). siScrambled, siARHGAP11A, or
siARHGAP11A-transfected cells, untreated or treated with PFI-7
(10μM), were plated into eight wells after 24 h of siRNA transfec-
tions (Figs 5Cand S4B). The next day, the medium was replaced with
or without DMSO (10μM) or PFI-7 (10μM) and placed inside the CO2
incubator of a phase-contrast microscope. Time-lapse imaging was
performed by taking an image every 30 min for 24 h using a 10X
objective. Eight randomﬁelds were acquired for each of the three
biological replicates to obtain data from at least 200 cells. The Nikon
Ti2-E wideﬁeld microscope equipped with a xy stage (Prior), a piezo
z-drive (Prior), and NIS-Elements software was used to take images.
Captured images were analyzed using the manual tracking plugin
and chemotaxis tool (ibidi) in ImageJ software. The tracking plot,
velocity, and overlay dot and line data were generated as described
elsewhere (Pijuan et al, 2019).
BioID2-MS
BioID2-MS experiments were carried out as previously described,
with modiﬁcations (Couzens et al, 2013; Methot et al, 2018; Bagci et al,
2020; Mehnert et al, 2020; Uliana et al, 2023). BirA2-Flag–expressed
cells were harvested after 24 h of tetracycline (1 μg/ml), biotin
(50 μM), MG132 (5μM), DMSO (5μM), or PFI-7 (10μM) treatment. They
were washed three times in PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer. They were then sonicated for 30 s
at 30% amplitude (three times of 10-s bursts with 2-s break between).
1μl Benzonase was added to each sample followed by a centrifu-
gation for 30 min at 4°C at maximum speed. Cleared lysates were
incubated with 70μl of streptavidin beads at 4°C for 3 h with rotation.
Streptavidin beads were then transferred in a 10 kD molecular weight
cutoff spin column (Vivacon 500; Sartorius), washed three times with
lysis buffer, then three times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
(ABC), pH 8.0. Samples were resuspended in 200μl ABC, transferred to
centrifugal units, and centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 8,000g.1 0 0μlo f
8M urea and 1μl of 500 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)
were added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at 37°C at
600 rpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer F1.5). 2μl of 500 mM iodoacetamide
was added to each sample and incubated for an additional 30 min at
37°C at 600 rpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer F1.5). Samples were then
centrifuged for 15 min at 8,000g and washed two times in 200μlA B C .
100 μlA B Ca n d1μg trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) were added
to each sample before incubation for 12 h at 37°C at 700 rpm
(Eppendorf ThermoMixer F1.5). The next day, tryptic proteolysis was
quenched with 5% formic acid and peptides were subjected to C18
cleanup (microspin column; The NeST Group), according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Eluted peptides were dried using
a speed vacuum and resuspended in 20μl of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1%
formic acid. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Q
Exactive + mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) coupled to
an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). Peptides were separated using a reverse-phase column
(75 μm ID x 400 mm New Objective, in-house packed with ReproSil
Gold 120 C18, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch GmbH) across a 120-min linear
gradient from 5 to 40% (buffer A: 0.1% [vol/vol] formic acid; buffer B:
0.1% [vol/vol] formic acid, and 95% [vol/vol] acetonitrile). The DDA
data acquisition mode was set to perform one MS1 scan followed by a
maximum of 16 scans for the top 16 most intense peptides (TOP16)
with MS1 scans (R = 70,000 at 400 m/z, AGC = 1 × 106, and maximum IT =
100 ms), HCD fragmentation (NCE = 27%), isolation windows (2.0 m/z),
and MS2 scans (R = 17,500 at 400 m/z, AGC = 1 × 105,a n dm a x i m u mI T=
50 ms). A dynamic exclusion of 30 s was applied, and charge states
lower than two and higher than seven were rejected for the isolation.
MS data analyses
Raw MSﬁles were analyzed using the X! Tandem (Bjornson et al, 2008)
and Mascot (Perkins et al, 1999) search engines through the iProphet
pipeline integrated in ProHits (Shteynberg et al, 2011; Liu et al, 2012).
RAW ﬁles were converted to .mzXMLﬁles using the ProteoWizard tool
(Kessner et al, 2008), and peptides were searched against the Human
RefSeq database (v.57) supplemented with common contaminants
MaxQuant, the Global Proteome Machine (http://www.thegpm.org/
crap/index.html), and decoy sequences. Mascot search parameters
were set with trypsin speciﬁcity (two missed cleavage allowed).
Oxidation (M) and deamidation (NQ) were set as variable modiﬁ-
cations, and carbamidomethyl as aﬁxed modiﬁcation. Mass toler-
ances for precursor and fragment ions were set to 15 ppm and 0.6 D,
respectively, and peptide charges of +2, +3, and +4 were considered. X!
Tandem and Mascot search results were individually processed by
PeptideProphet, and peptides were assembled into proteins using
parsimony rules using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (Deutsch et al,
2023) with the following parameters: p 0.05 -x20 -PPM -“DECOY”;
iProphet options: pPRIME; and PeptideProphet: pP (protein proba-
bility > 0.9). The quantiﬁcation approach was based on the spectral
counts of the identiﬁed proteins.
Interaction scoring
We applied SAINTexpress (v.3.6.1) to proteins identiﬁed with at least
one unique peptide. Each set of proteomics data for baits (GID4 WT
or E237A mutant, ARMC8, untreated or treated with MG132 [5 mM],
DMSO [10μM], or PFI-7 [10μM] for 24 h) was individually compared
GID4 degrades ARHGAP11A for migration Bagci et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202403046 vol 7 | no 12 | e202403046 15 of 21
with its corresponding negative control dataset and analyzed in
three independent biological replicates. The negative controls for
BioID2-MS experiments include BirA2-Flag-EGFP untreated or
treated with MG132 (5μM) for 24 h and were analyzed in three
independent biological replicates, similar to baits. SAINT analyses
were carried out with the following settings: number of controls: 6,
compressed controls: 4, compressed baits: 2. A BFDR cutoff of 0.01
has been applied toﬁlter contaminants or non-speciﬁc interac-
tions. Interactions displaying a BFDR≤ 1% were considered as high
conﬁdence, 1% < BFDR≤ 5% as medium conﬁdence, and BFDR > 5%
as low conﬁdence. Unﬁltered contaminants (http://www.thegpm.org/
crap/index.html) were removed.
Dot plot analyses
SAINT outputﬁles of untreated or MG132 BirA2-Flag-GID4, BirA2-
Flag-GID4E237A, WDR26-BirA2-Flag, or ARMC8-BirA2-Flag bait data
analyzed in ProHits were processed using the ProHits-viz platform
to carry out dot plot analyses (Choi et al, 2011;Knight et al, 2017).
Experimental controls such as BirA2-Flag-EGFP treated or not with
MG132 have been used in SAINT analyses toﬁlter non-speciﬁc
interactions.
Protein–protein association networks and clustering
Proteins identiﬁed in SAINT output ﬁles were analyzed by the
STRING database to generate the protein –protein association
networks or functionally relevant protein clusters. Protein clusters
were obtained after MCL clustering using STRING v11.5 (Szklarczyk
et al, 2019). The MCL inﬂation parameter was 3, and the protein–
protein interaction enrichment P-value was 2.33 × 10−12. Known
interactions were extracted from curated databases including
Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG, or Reactome. Experimentally deter-
mined interactions were extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD,
IntAct, MINT, or PID. Text mining–based interactions were extracted
from the scientiﬁc literature as determined by STRING (Szklarczyk
et al, 2019).
Protein sequence alignment and analysis
Alignment and analysis of prey protein sequences identiﬁed in
BioID2 were performed using Jalview software version 2.11.2.6
(Waterhouse et al, 2009). The ﬁrst N-terminal amino acids, ex-
cluding Met at the ﬁrst position, were submitted to Jalview. The
conserved residues were colored using the Clustal color scheme.
Sequence logo analysis
Theﬁrst nine N-terminal amino acids, excluding the N-terminal
methionine, of the protein sequences of the GID4 degradation
substrate candidates identi ﬁed by BioID2 were submitted to
Seq2Logo 2.0 (Thomsen & Nielsen, 2012 )f o rs e q u e n c el o g o
analysis with the following inputs: (1) logo type: shannon; (2)
clustering method: clustering (Hobohm1); (3) threshold for clus-
tering (Hobohm1): 0.63; and (4) weight on prior (pseudo-count
correction for low counts): 200, using the human proteome as
background.
Co-immunoprecipitations, GST-RBD pulldown, siRNA KD of hGID
subunits, ubiquitination, and half-life measurements
Co-immunoprecipitations and ubiquitination assay
Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells from experiments as in Figs 3C and
S3A–E were lysed in 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-
propanesulfonate (CHAPS) buffer (30 mM Tris –HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1% CHAPS) supplemented with in-
hibitors (5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na2VO4, and 1x cOmplete, EDTA-free
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). HeLa cells from experiments as in
Fig 3Dwere lysed in Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1% NP-40) supplemented with
the same inhibitors used in experiments as inFigs 3Cand S3A–E.I n
both experiments, cleared TCLs were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with an
anti-ﬂag M2 afﬁnity gel (FLAG beads). Bound co-immunoprecipitated
proteins (IP-FLAG) and unbound TCLs were subjected to Western
blotting using the indicated antibodies against endogenous or ex-
ogenous (FLAG, HA, and Myc-tagged) proteins. For the experiment
shown inFig 3D, to avoid potential background noise from membrane
stripping, the IP-Flag samples from the same set of experiments were
loaded onto separate gels, and subsequently transferred to different
membranes, which were then individually probed with either Flag or
HA antibodies (IP-Flag/Flag or IP-Flag/HA upper panels).
siRNA KD of hGID subunits
HeLa cells from the experiment as inFig 4Awere transfected with
siScrambled (50 nM), siGID4 (50 nM), siWDR26 (50 nM), siARMC8 (50
nM), or siRANBP9 (50 nM) for 48 h. After transfection, cells were
lysed in NP-40 buffer supplemented with the same inhibitors used
in experiments as inFigs 3Cand S3A–E. Cleared TCLs were subjected
to Western blotting using the indicated antibodies against en-
dogenous ARHGAP11A, HBP1, GID4, WDR26, ARMC8, RANBP9, or
GAPDH proteins.
GST-RBD pulldown
GST or GST-RBD fusion proteins were puriﬁed from BL21 bacteria and
coupled with GST beads as described previously (Bagci et al, 2020).
The expression of puriﬁed GST or GST-RBD was assessed by Coo-
massie. HeLa sgControl, sgGID4 KD #1, or sgGID4 KD #2 cells from
experiment as inFig 6Ewere transfected with siScrambled (20 nM) or
siARHGAP11A (20 nM) and were either untreated or treated with PFI-7
(10μM). Cells were then lysed in CHAPS buffer with the aforemen-
tioned inhibitors and incubated with beads coupled with GST or GST-
RBD for 3 h at 4°C. Bound pulldown proteins (pulldown GST) and
unbound TCLs were subjected to Western blotting using the indi-
cated antibodies against endogenous RhoA or GAPDH proteins.
Half-life measurements
HeLa sgControl or sgGID4 KD #1 cells from experiments as inFig 3A
and Bwere untreated (time at 0 h) or treated with 20μg/ml CHX at
times 2, 4, or 8 h. For the experiments as inFig 4C and D, Flp-In T-REx
HeLa cells expressing ARHGAP11Aiso1-Flag or ARHGAP11Aiso3-Flag
were transfected with siScrambled (20 nM) or siGID4 (20 nM) for 48
h. After transfection, the medium was replaced, and cells were
untreated (time at 0 h) or treated with 20μg/ml CHX at times 2, 4, or
8 h. Cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer with the aforementioned
inhibitors. Extracted TCLs were subjected to Western blotting using
GID4 degrades ARHGAP11A for migration Bagci et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202403046 vol 7 | no 12 | e202403046 16 of 21
the indicated antibodies against Flag or endogenous ARHGAP11A,
KIFC1, RACGAP1, or GAPDH.
Immunoﬂuorescence
7,500 HeLa cells per condition were plated on coverslips 1 d before
ﬁxation with 4% PFA. Cells were permeabilized with PBS/0.30%
Triton X-100, and blocked in PBS/0.30% Triton X-100/1% BSA for
1 h at RT followed by an overnight incubation with the ARHGAP11A
antibody, or not. The next day, samples were washed three times in
PBS and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488
antibody for 1 h at RT with 1:1,000 dilution. Samples were then
washed three times in PBS and incubated with rhodamine phal-
loidin for 1 h at RT with a 1:400 dilution. Samples were washed again
three times with PBS, and incubated with DAPI for 5 min at RT with a
1:10,000 dilution. Samples were washed three times with PBS.
Coverslips were then mounted on microscopy slides using ProLong
Diamond Antifade Mountant andﬁxed with a nail polish. The Leica
SP8 AOBS confocal microscope was used to take images, using a
63x/1.4 oil immersion objective. The following excitation lasers were
used: 405 nM for DAPI (blue channel), 488 nM for Alexa Fluor 488
(green channel), and 561 nM for rhodamine phalloidin (magenta
channel). Images were processed using Leica Application Suite X
(Las X) software. The contrast was adjusted throughout the whole
image to enhance visibility when necessary. Z-stack images were
converted to maximum projections and exported to Adobe Illus-
trator to prepareﬁgures. 100 cells were analyzed for each condition.
To quantify the percentage of ARHGAP11A enrichment at the cell
periphery, regions of interest were created afterﬁnding the
boundaries of the cell periphery by setting a threshold on the green
channel, as described elsewhere (DesMarais et al, 2019). The nu-
clear ﬂuorescence of ARHGAP11A was excluded from the analysis.
The ﬂuorescence intensity of the regions of interest was analyzed
using the ImageJ tool and exported to GraphPad Prism 9 software
for further analysis.
Peptide binding assays
Protein puriﬁcation
GID4Δ1–115, N-terminally tagged with 2xStrepII-Smt3, was expressed in
Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS cells in Terriﬁc Broth medium at 25°C overnight.
After expression, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended
in lysis buffer (Strep buffer supplemented with PMSF, leupeptin,
pepstatin A, DNase I, and lysozyme), and lysed by high-pressure
homogenization (Emulsiﬂex). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifu-
gation at 50,000g for 60 min, and supernatants were loaded onto a
5 ml Strep-Tactin Superﬂow column (QIAGEN), washed with Strep
buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% [vol/vol]
glycerol), and Strep buffer–supplemented with 1 M NaCl before
elution. An eluate was incubated with Ulp1 overnight and passed back
over a 5-ml Strep-Tactin Superﬂow column. Finally, GID4Δ1–115 was
puriﬁed via size-exclusion chromatography in Strep buffer.
Fluorescence polarization (FP)
Saturation binding experiments were performed similarly as
described previously ( Chrustowicz et al, 2022 ). In brief, 20 nM
WDQRLV-TAMRA or PGLWKS-TAMRA was incubated with indicated
GID4Δ1–115 concentrations for 10 min in FP buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH
7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM D-Trehalose, 1% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.01%
[vol/vol] Triton X-100, and 0.1 g/l BSA). Samples were transferred
to Corning 384-wellﬂat bottom plates (3575; Corning), and the FP
signal was recorded using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG LAB-
TECH). FP data were normalized against aﬂuorescent peptide-
only control and ﬁtt oao n es i t e - s p e c iﬁc binding model in
GraphPad Prism.
Competitive FP assays were performed as described previously
(Chrustowicz et al, 2022 ). Brieﬂy, 20 μM GID4Δ1–115 and 20 nM
PGLWKS-TAMRA peptides were incubated for 10 min with twofold
dilutions of unlabeled peptides in FP buffer, and the FP signal was
measured on a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG LABTECH). Unlabeled
peptides were dissolved in DMSO. Thus, all FP data were baseline-
corrected against appropriate DMSO concentrations. Displacement
of PGLWKS-TAMRA was calculated as the ratio of free versus
GID4Δ1–115-bound PGLWKS-TAMRA. To determine IC50 values, nor-
malized FP data were plotted against log(inhibitor) andﬁtted with a
log(inhibitor) versus response model with variable slope in
GraphPad Prism.
Live-cell FRET measurements and data analysis
Stable cell line generation
Stable cell lines expressing RhoA second-generation biosensor
(RhoA2G) in HeLa or REF52 cells were generated using the fol-
lowing protocol. Cells were transfected with 1,250 ng of the pPB 3.0
puro RhoA2G vector and with 1,250 ng of the Super piggyBac
Transposase expression vector. HeLa cells were selected in the
presence of puromycin (10μg/ml) for 10–20 d. Cell death was
observed within 3 or 4 d upon puromycin treatment. Isolated
clones were trypsinized, pooled together, and plated into new 10-
cm plates in fresh selection medium to generate stable RhoA2G-
HeLa cells. Stable cell lines were transfected with siScrambled
(negative control) or siGID4 using RNAiMAX according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. GID4 KD efﬁciency was veriﬁed
by Western blot.
Image acquisition
Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope
with a 20x Plan Apochromat objective, using a Prime 95B sCMOS
camera with 2 x 2 pixel binning. For RhoA2G biosensor imaging, the
donor and FRET channels were excited using a Lumencor Spectra
X 440 nm LED. Sequential imaging of donor and FRET channels was
p e r f o r m e dw i t he x c i t a t i o nﬁlters 430/24 and a Dichroic Q465 long-
pass ﬁlter. For donor emission, a 480/40-nmﬁlter was used, and
for FRET emission, a 535/30-nmﬁlter was used. Cells were imaged
in FluoroBrite DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 0.5% BSA,
stable L-glutamine (4 mM), and penicillin–streptomycin (200 U/
ml).
Data analysis
FRET analysis was performed using the custom Python code in line
with the procedure described elsewhere (Spiering et al, 2013). For
time-series measurements with PFI-7, ratios were normalized to

Data presentation and statistical analysis
BFDR of 0.01 was used toﬁlter non-speciﬁc BioID2-MS interactions
from the dot plot analyses. The GO-term enrichment score was
determined as the–log10 of adjustedP-values, calculated by the g:
Proﬁler tool. For other experiments, GraphPad Prism 9 was used to
generate quantiﬁcation graphs and carry out statistical analysis.
Co-immunoprecipitation, GST-RBD pulldown, or half-life mea-
surements were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software. Selected lanes
(Analyze/Gels/Plot Lanes) were plotted, and the intensity of each
protein band was measured using the wand tracing tool and
normalized to the total RhoA (for GST-RBD pulldown) or GAPDH (for
all other Western blot experiments) levels. For experiments com-
paring two conditions, the indicatedP-values were calculated using
a two-tailed t test. For experiments including multiple conditions,
the indicated P-values were calculated using one-way ANOVA,
followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons. Data values for
experiments comparing two or multiple conditions are shown as
the mean ± SD. For the quantiﬁcation of protein amount or en-
richment in percentage, data values were normalized by setting the
group with the highest mean to a percentage between 70% and
100%. All other groups were then normalized using the same co-
efﬁcient, ensuring consistent comparison across all samples. The
indicated P-values are as follows: ns (not signiﬁcant), *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤
0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and ****P ≤ 0.0001. Figs 1Aand 2A are created using
BioRender software.
