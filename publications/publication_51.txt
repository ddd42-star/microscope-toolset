Abstract
Previous studies demonstrated that p190RhoGAP (p190) negatively affects cytokinesis in a Rho-
GAP-dependent manner, suggesting that regulation of Rho may be a critical mechanism of p190
action during cytokinesis. P190 localizes to the cleavage furrow (CF) of dividing cells, and its levels
decrease during late mitosis by an ubiquitin-mediated mechanism, consistent with the hypothesis
that high RhoGTP levels are required for completion of cytokinesis. To determine whether RhoGTP
levels in the CF are affected by p190 and to define the phase(s) of cytokinesis in which p190 is
involved, we used FRET analysis alone or in combination with time lapse microscopy. In normal
cell division activated Rho accumulated at the cell equator in early anaphase and in the contractile
ring, where it co-localized with p190. Real-time movies revealed that cells expressing elevated levels
of p190 exhibited multiple cycles of abnormal CF site selection and ingression/regression, which
resulted in failed or prolonged cytokinesis. This was accompanied by mislocalization of active Rho
at the aberrant CF sites. Quantified data revealed that in contrast to ECT2 and dominate negative
p190 (Y1283Ap190), which resulted in hyper-activated Rho, Rho activity in the CF was reduced by
wild type p190 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that p190 regulates cytokinesis
through modulation of Rho-GTP levels, thereby affecting CF specification site selection and
subsequent ring contraction.

Introduction
Cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, is initiated at the metaphase to anaphase transition
by specification of the cleavage plane, followed by furrow assembly and ingression, midbody
formation, and cell separation. This process results in the production of two daughter cells,
each with an equal complement of chromosomes and membrane [1,2]. The molecular
requirements for these events appear to be conserved in animal cells, since a core set of proteins
have been found to be important for cytokinesis [3,4]. Among them are the two major

cytoskeleton components, microtubules and actin, as well as their motor proteins, kinesins and
myosins. Early studies demonstrated by physical manipulation of the central spindle apparatus
that selection of the cleavage plane initiation site and contractile ring assembly are mediated
by mitotic spindle microtubules [5,6]. While multiple reports substantiate these findings,
evidence suggests that astral microtubules may also play an important role in these events
[7–12]. Cleavage furrow (CF) assembly and contraction involve actin filaments, myosin II,
septins, and actin-interacting proteins, such as profilin and cofilin [3].
Accumulating evidence suggests that RhoGTPases and their regulated local activities are also
critical for successful completion of mitosis [13,14]. Cells depleted of Rho protein by siRNA
or of Rho activity by treatment with C3 transferase, show cytokinesis defects [15–27]. Rho is
important not only for CF specification through microtubules but also for furrow formation
and contraction through actinmyosin via its downstream targets, including ROCK, citron
kinase, LIM kinase, and formin-homology proteins [3]. The molecular mechanisms by which
Rho is localized and activated to mediate CF specification, ring assembly and contraction are
still poorly understood. While multiple models have been proposed to delineate these events
[10,13,28], the current consensus is that initial positioning of the furrow is dependent on local
enrichment and activation of Rho [13,14,22]. This process can be regulated by the
centralspindlin complex, composed of a Rho family GTPase activating protein (GAP), CYK4/
MgcRacGAP, and a kinesin protein, MKLP1. ECT2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) for Rho, is also recruited by centralspindlin to this region where it can activate Rho
[26,27,29,30]. Until recently, it has been a challenge to visualize the active pool of Rho at the
CF. Now, a number of different probes have permitted detection of the active population, but
the results are conflicting and differ by method and cell type used [22,26,31]. The study
reported here utilizes a single chain FRET biosensor that detects conformational changes in
Rho that occur upon GDP-GTP exchange, yet still maintains Rho’s sensitivity to its regulators
[32,33]
At any given point in time and space, the activity of Rho represents a balance between its GTP-
and GDP-bound states, which is mediated by the combined action of guanine nucleotide
dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), GEFs, and GAPs. ECT2 and CYK-4/mgcRacGAP are
candidates for performing the Rho GEF and GAP functions, as both localize to the cytokinetic
apparatus and are critical for cytokinesis [26,29,34–38]. MgcRacGAP is the human homolog
of CYK-4 and required for cytokinesis. Since its primary target is Rac in vitro, whether
MgcRacGAP has Rho GAP activity in vivo during cytokinesis is unclear [39,40].
However, previous studies have revealed another RhoGAP, p190RhoGAP (p190), that exhibits
specific GAP activity for Rho in vivo and localizes to the CF [41,42]. P190 is a multidomain
and multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in regulating actin stress fiber dynamics
by negatively regulating Rho and promoting actin stress fiber disassembly [42–48].
Endogenous p190 is degraded in late mitosis by a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway.
Gene silencing strategies to further define the role of p190 in cytokinesis have been
uninformative, because p190-silenced cells become highly adherent and flattened and fail to
even enter mitosis. In contrast, studies involving overexpression of p190 have shown that p190
induces multinucleation and mis-localization of the cleavage plane specification site,
suggesting that it functions in the early stages of cytokinesis. These effects of p190 are observed
in multiple mammalian cell lines and are dependent on its RhoGAP domain. Together, these
characteristics of p190 suggest that its effects on cytokinesis may be mediated in part through
Rho.
To test this hypothesis, we used time lapse microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) technology to analyze the effect of p190 on living cells and on Rho activity
during cytokinesis. In normally dividing cells, FRET analysis demonstrated that activated Rho

localized to the cell equator at the furrow specification plane in early anaphase and to the CF
during cytoknesis, where it co-localized with p190. Real-time microscopy showed that
overexpression of p190 resulted in defective and delayed mitosis through abnormal and/or
failed specification of the CF plane and cycles of ingression/regression in both HeLa and MDA-
MB 468 breast cancer cells. These abnormalities were accompanied by aberrant localization
and reduced levels of active Rho in the CF. P190 overexpression reduced, while ECT2 and
dominant negative p190 (Y1283A p190) increased Rho activity in the CF in a dose-dependent
manner. Together, these data support the conclusion that p190 affects selection of the cleavage
plane and ingression of the contractile ring through regulation of Rho activity in the CF during
cytokinesis
Materials and methods
Tissue culture and transfection
Tet-on HA-tagged p190RhoGAP MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells [41] were cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and antibiotics and induced to overexpress p190 by addition of 1 ug/ml
doxcycline (DOX) to the culture medium for the indicated time. HeLa cells, cultured in DMEM
with 10% serum, were transfected with Rho biosensor variants and p190 variants or ECT2
using Polyfect (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rho
biosensors were introduced into 468 cells by the same method and simultaneously treated with
DOX to induce expression of p190. Cells were fixed and stained 24 hrs post transfection and
visualized on a fluorescent microscope (Orthoplan; E. Leitz, Inc., Rockleigh, NJ).
Plasmids
The pkH3190 plasmid, which encodes an N-terminal triple HA-tagged full-length, wild type
(wt) p190, and GFP-p190 were gifts from Ian Macara [47]. Mutant P190Y1283A, previously
shown to be deficient for RhoGAP activity [48], was cloned into the pKH3 vector at the BamH1
and EcoR1 sites. RFPp190 was cloned into the pTriEXmRFP vector at the BamH1 and EcoR1
sites. The various Rho biosensors (wtRho, T19NRho and Q63LRho) were cloned into the
pTriEx vector as described [32]. Each biosensor consists of a CFP-RBD (Rho binding domain
from rhotekin) and YFP-Rho (wtRho, RhoQ63L or RhoT19N) connected by a linker.
Constituitively active ECT2 (ECT2C {residues 414–883} hereafter referred to as ECT2) was
cloned into the pcDNA3Flag vector at the EcoR1 and BamH1 sites. Expression of HA-tagged
p190 and Flag-tagged ECT2 was verified by Western immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence.
Generation of HeLa cells stably expressing the Rho biosensor
HeLa cells were co-transfected with the Rho biosensor and pBabe (puromycin) plasmids at a
molar ratio of 10:1, respectively, and selected with 400ng/ml puromycin in tissue culture
medium for 6 days. YFP positive cells were sorted by Becton Dickinson FACSVantage SE
Turbo Sorter at 488nm. Stable transfectants were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented
with 400ng/ml puromycin and 10% FBS and utilized for live FRET imaging.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described in [44]. Two ug/ml anti-HA
monoclonal antibody (mAb), (HA11 {Covance, Berkeley, CA}) and 2 ug/ml anti-Flag M2
mAb (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used as primary antibodies to stain p190 and ECT2,
respectively. Two ug/ml Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes,
Inc., Eugene, OR) served as the secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted on microscope
slides, and cells were viewed on a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope with a 60× 1.3 NA lens

for FRET images or on a Zeiss LSM 510 UV confocal microscope equipped with a Plan
Apochromat 100×/1.4 NA oil immersion lens for confocal images.
Movies and images
Hela or MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 0.17 mm Delta T dishes (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA) and cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. P190 expression was induced by addition of 1ug/ml Dox to
MDA-MB-468 tet-on cells or by transient transfection of pKH3p190, GFP p190, or RFPp190
into Hela cells. Both 468 and HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated biosensor as
described above. Movies were taken 24 hrs after exogenous p190 induction or transfection.
Ten ug/ml OxyFluor (Oxyrase, Inc, Mansfield, OH) was added to the medium before taking
movies to facilitate the capture of fluorescent images. Images were taken with a Nikon TE200
inverted microscope, equipped with a 60× 1.3 NA lens and a Hamamatsu camera controller,
and analyzed with OpenLab software. Temperature in the dish was controlled by a Bioptechs
Delta T4 Culture Dish Controller. For FRET movies of living cells, RFPp190- and/or
biosensor-positive mitotic cells were selected by FACS sorting, and CFP/YFP, CFP/CFP and
DIC images were taken every min.
FRET analysis
HeLa cells were synchronized (see below) and transfected with the various Rho biosensors or
cotransfected with either the pKH3p190 or ECT2 constructs as described above. Cells were
fixed and stained for either p190 or ECT2 and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For
FRET analysis, the following wave length filters were used: CFP excitation - 436/10nm; CFP
emission - 470/30nm; YFP excitation - 493/17nm; YFP emission - 535/30nm; Alexa Fluor 594
excitation - 575/25 and emission - 630/60. Three images were captured for each field: CFP
excitation and CFP emission (CC), CFP excitation and YFP emission (CY) and YFP excitation
and YFP emission (YY). Fluorescence ratio images are presented as CY/CC, showing the
relative Rho specific activity in cells. The ratio range is depicted by the colored bar, with red
showing the highest and blue the lowest ratio. Digital densitometric measurements of
fluorescence intensity (CFP, YFP, or Alexa Fluor 594) in each cell (or designated part of each
cell) include background subtraction. OpenLab software was used for the image analysis.
Cell cycle synchronization
Cells were synchronized in mitosis by incubation in 2 mM thymidine (Sigma) in tissue culture
medium for 12–16 hrs, washed and released from the block by incubation in normal medium
for 8–10 hrs. During release, cells were transfected with different Rho biosensors or
cotransfected with pKH3-p190 or Flag-ECT2 constructs. Cells were then fixed, stained, and
visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
Results
Ectopic expression of p190RhoGAP induces a mitotic defect in living cells
Our previous studies showed that overexpression of p190 induced multinucleation in both
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HeLa cells, suggesting a role for p190 in cytokinesis.
Employing conventional immunofluorescence of fixed cells, we obtained initial evidence that
p190 can affect cleavage plane specification. To visualize the effect of p190 overexpression
in real time and to gain additional insights into its mechanism of action, we produced movies
of 468 cells that inducibly overexpress p190 in response to tetracycline (doxycycline) or of
HeLa cells transiently transfected to express GFP-tagged p190. In movies S1 and S2,
recordings were started 24 hrs after exogenous p190 was induced by 1ug/ml doxcycline (DOX)
in 468 cells. Figure 1a depicts selected images in sequence over a 12 hr period from movie S1.

In these asynchronous cultures, the arrows identify four cells attempting to undergo mitosis.
These cells either took an abnormally long time to transit mitosis (at least 12 hours, see cells
2, 3, and 4), as compared to control cells (about 3 hrs) in Figure 1c, or appeared to undergo
apoptosis (cells 1 and 3). All suffered mitotic failure. When cells entered mitosis, it appeared
that the division planes could be positioned at anaphase (sometimes abnormally – see cells 3
and 4) and ring contraction was initiated. But the rings retracted, and several cells tried to
reposition the furrow, in some instances repeatedly (cells 2, 3, and 4). Movie S2 and Figure 1b
show at higher magnification one cell that attempted multiple times to define the cleavage
plane and divide. Quantitation from a 20 hrs movie (total of 30 cells) revealed that about 30%
of the cells failed to complete mitosis, while 16% eventually divided into two daughter cells
after a prolonged time. All of the mitotic cells made multiple attempts to define the cleavage
plane and underwent partial ingression. About 17% became apoptotic, as determined by
morphological changes. This abnormal phenomena is consistent with our previous
observations in fixed cells, in which large, multinucleated and multi-lobed cells were seen in
p190 overexpressors [41]. Figure 1c and movie S3 depict cultures of tet-on 468 cells
undergoing normal division in the absence of Dox (see cells 1, 2, and 3). Together, these data
suggest that p190 overexpression can result in multiple mitotic phenotypes, including abnormal
division plane selection, restricted CF contraction followed by regression, and cycles of faulty
site selection and unsuccessful division, all resulting in delayed or unproductive mitosis.
Membrane blebbing, cell rounding, and condensed chromatin were also observed, consistent
with the cells undergoing apoptosis.
To determine whether this phenomena was cell type-specific, we transiently transfected
GFPp190 into Hela cells and started recording 24 hrs after transfection. Figure 1d and movie
S4 feature four GFPp190 expressing cells (noted by arrows and numbers). None of these four
cells initiated CF contraction or cell division within the 40 hr time-frame of the movie, although
all four exhibited the rounded morphology of mitotic cells. Two of them (cells 3 and 4) detached
from the dish at the end of movie, and two others (cells 1 and 2) failed to divide. However, the
majority of non-GFPp190 expressing cells near the GFPp190 positive cells underwent cell
division. These data further support our hypothesis that overexpression of p190 disrupts the
initiation of the cleavage plane and demonstrate that this phenomenon is not cell type-specific.
p190RhoGAP and Rho colocalize at the CF during cytokinesis
Our previous data showed that endogenous p190 co-localized with actin to the CF specification
site in early anaphase and to the CF during ring contraction [41]. To determine whether p190
and Rho co-localized at these sites, we examined by confocal microscopy their subcellular
localization in HeLa cells throughout mitosis. Figure 2 shows that HA-p190 (red) colocalized
with wtRho (green) at the CF throughout the various stages of cytokinesis, further supporting
the idea that p190 regulates Rho in cytokinesis.
Localization of active Rho to the equatorial zone and the CF during cytokinesis
Rho GTPase, the major in vivo target of p190RhoGAP [42], is required for CF formation,
ingression and stabilization, but its spatio-temporal regulation during cytokinesis is unclear.
To further study the function of p190 in cytokinesis and its effect on Rho activity, we employed
a recently developed Rho biosensor which detects RhoA conformational changes [32]. The
biosensor is a single, genetically encoded chain consisting of RBD (Rho binding domain from
rhotekin) linked to RhoA (either wtRho, constitutively active [ca] RhoQ63L or dominant
negative [dn] RhoT19N). In the linker between these molecules are two mutants of GFP that
undergo FRET (CFP and YFP). When the Rho is in an active, GTP-bound form, it binds the
RBD, causing the orientation to change and the distance between the GFP mutants to diminish,
thereby inducing FRET. The ratio of FRET/CFP provides a measure of localized Rho

activation. The GFP mutants are placed in the middle of the chain to leave the C terminus free
for normal regulation by GDI [32].
Using the Rho biosensor, we examined the subcellular localization of active Rho at different
stages of mitosis. The various Rho biosensors (wtRho, RhoQ63L, and RhoT19N) were
transfected separately into HeLa cells. Initially, a dose-dependency study was conducted to
determine the lowest amount of transfected plasmid that would generate a FRET signal while
avoiding potential artifacts of high overexpression. This amount was used throughout the study.
Following transfection, cells were synchronized in different stages of mitosis by release from
a thymidine block for varying lengths of time (8–11 hrs), fixed and imaged. The fluorescence
ratio and controls for protein distribution and bleaching were carried out as previously
described [32]. Figure 3 shows that active Rho was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in
metaphase cells but concentrated at the initial points of furrow formation (furrow specification
site) in early anaphase and at the CF throughout ring contraction. At the end of cytokinesis,
when the two daughter cells were separated, RhoGTP re-localized to the cytoplasm. The
fluorescence ratio and levels of caQ63LRho and dnT19NRho are shown for comparison. A
similar localization of the active Rho biosensors was also observed in living cells (see Figure
5), suggesting that the localization was not affected by the fixation process. This pattern of
Rho activation is consistent with recent publications, in which a single fluorescence-conjugated
RBD was used as a probe to follow the spatiotemporal regulation of Rho [22,26]. These results
further support the involvement of Rho in CF site specification and contraction.
P190RhoGAP and ECT2 co-regulate Rho activity in the CF during cytokinesis
Our previous studies showed that the GAP domain of overexpressed p190 was required for
induction of multinucleation, suggesting that p190 might regulate Rho activity during
cytokinesis. To more rigorously test this hypothesis, we co-transfected HeLa cells with HA-
tagged p190 and each of the various Rho bio-sensors. Cells were synchronized in mitosis, fixed,
stained with anti-HA mAb, and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy for levels of
p190. Although individual cells expressed varying levels of HA-p190 as visualized by
immunofluorescence, Western blotting of extracts prepared from populations of cells revealed
no greater than 2–3 fold overexpression relative to endogenous p190 (Fig. 4b and data not
shown). Rho biosensor expression was detected by YFP excitation (493nm) and emission
(535nm) (YY). Rho activity was assessed by ratio imaging of the CF (area delineated by the
oval) during cytokinesis (i.e., FRET signal normalized to the amount of Rho biosensor per cell
{CY/CC}). Figure 4a, upper panels, shows two cells undergoing cytokinesis, both of which
co-express HA-p190 and wtRho biosensor. The cell expressing the higher level of p190 can
be seen to generate the lower Rho activity at the CF, suggesting a dose-dependency of p190
action. The middle and lower series of panels show that neither caRho nor dnRho activity was
affected by p190 co-expression.
Quantitative analysis of biosensor signals from several independent experiments (a minimum
of 10 cells per treatment group) revealed that p190 significantly reduced Rho activity at the
CF as compared to cells expressing the biosensor alone (Fig. 4b, upper panel). In contrast,
overexpression of ECT2, an established activator of Rho in cytokinesis, significantly increased
levels of Rho activity in the CF. Similar to ECT2, a high-level (>5 fold wt p190) of a GAP
inactive mutant of p190 (Y1283A) significantly increased Rho activity at the CF, while
expression of the mutant at the same level as transfected wt p190 had no effect. Moreover, the
subcellular location of Y1283Ap190 in different stages of mitosis mimicked that of wt-p190
(supplemental figure S9) and co-localized with Rho throughout mitosis. These results suggest
that the GAP deficient mutant functioned as a dominant negative, interfering with the activity
of endogenous p190 (Fig. 4b, upper panel). The lower panel of Fig. 4b shows the expression
levels of wt and mutant p190 used in the experiments. caRho and dnRho biosensors generated

the highest and lowest activation levels, respectively, among all the treatment groups, but these
signals were not altered by either p190 or ECT2. In comparison, Rho activity in interphase
cells was slightly reduced by p190 but not significantly changed by ECT2 (data not show).
Figure 4c demonstrates that the extent to which p190 downmodulated and ECT2 increased the
activity of Rho was indeed dependent on the amount of p190 or ECT2 expressed. Together,
these data suggest that p190 functions upstream of Rho to downregulate Rho signaling during
cytokinesis in a dose-dependent manner.
FRET analysis of RhoGTP in living cells expressing ectopic p190: Reduced and mislocalized
RhoGTP is associated with mitotic defects
To study the effect of p190 on the dynamic activity of Rho during cytokinesis in living cells,
the Rho biosensor and p190 were co-expressed in 468 and HeLa cells, and the distribution of
Rho activity was followed by FRET analysis. Both cell lines exhibited a defect in CF site
selection, as evidenced by the oscillations of the Rho activity zone and furrow ingression/
regression. The upper panels of Figure 5a and movie S5 show a 468 cell induced to overexpress
p190 and undergoing cytokinesis, juxtaposed to cells in interphase. The phenotype of the cell
was similar to that seen in Figure 1 and movies S1 and S2, in which cells attempted multiple
times to specify a CF. At the beginning of the movie, the CF was sited near the equator, where
high Rho activity could be seen (arrows, frame 1). A new CF region was then defined by a new
Rho activity zone, and the original Rho activity zone disappeared (arrows, frame 2). Finally,
the CF returned to the original site (frames 3–5). Cell separation was not observed during the
41 mins of the movie, and Rho activity in the CFs appeared to be suppressed. In contrast, cells
lacking exogenous p190 displayed normal progression through cytokinesis (Figure 5a, lower
panels and movie S6). Rho activity was concentrated at the equatorial region and remained
until the two cells separated. The process took less than 10 min.
Figure 5b (upper and lower panels), movies S7 and S8, show Rho activity changes during
cytokinesis in HeLa cells with or without RFPp190 expression. Without exogenous p190
(lower panel and S8), Rho activity was cortically distributed in metaphse then concentrated to
the CF area and both poles during anaphase and telophase until the two cells separated. The
process was completed in ~10 min. However, in RFPp190 expressing cells (upper panel and
S7), Rho activity failed to concentrate in the equatorial CF area, CF sites migrated back and
forth between the two daughter cells, and eventually the two daughter cells rejoined, but failed
to divide. These data strongly support the hypothesis that p190 affects CF specification in early
anaphase by reducing Rho activity at the CF and inhibiting cytokinesis. As such, p190 functions
as an important negative regulator of mitotic progression.
Discussion
One of the mysteries of cytokinesis is the molecular mechanism by which the cleavage plane
is established. Much evidence suggests that the cleavage plane is specified by the anaphase
mitotic spindle, perhaps through regulation of Rho GTPase. In support of this model are the
findings that active RhoA becomes concentrated at the cleavage plane specification site before
ring contraction and that this accumulation is independent of actin and myosin II, but dependent
on ECT2 and the centraspindlin complex [22,26,27,30].
Data in this paper together with our previous observations indicate that p190 may also play a
role in CF site selection. Specifically, using immunofluorescence of fixed cells, p190
overexpression was shown to induce abnormal positioning of CF specification sites and
formation of large, multi-lobed cells [41]. In the current study we used time lapse microscopy
of living cells alone or in combination with FRET analysis and observed that p190
overexpression resulted in mitotic defects that arose through inappropriate selection of the
cleavage plane, failure to concentrate and retain high RhoGTP levels at the selected sites, and

an inability to complete ring contraction. These defects resulted in abnormal cell shapes,
including membrane blebbing, a mark of apoptosis. All of these data suggest that without the
appropriate amount of p190, especially in the early stages of cytokinesis, the process can go
awry. This conclusion is consistent with our previous findings that p190 is degraded in late
mitosis, perhaps after it has fulfilled its function in early and mid-cytokinesis.
An alternative approach utilized by our laboratory to investigate the role of p190 in cytokinesis
was gene silencing. Unexpectedly, knock-down of p190 resulted in failure of cells to enter
mitosis. Cells with reduced p190 exhibited a highly flattened morphology and were unable to
release from the substratum and round up, thereby preventing initiation of mitosis. While
uninformative with regard to cytokinesis, these results suggested that p190 plays multiple roles
in the cell cycle, one at the G2/M border (early prophase, as revealed by gene silencing) and
another in cytokinesis (as revealed by overexpression). In fact, Burridge and coworkers have
suggested a role for p190 in early prophase that involves contraction of the actinomyosin
network at the cell cortex, a process involved in cell rounding [49].
While the GAP domain of p190 is critical to its function in cytokinesis, other domains within
the molecule may also contribute to the process. P190 is a large protein that contains multiple
protein-protein interaction motifs, including an N-terminal GTP binding domain [50], FF
domains that mediate interactions with RNA binding proteins [51], polyproline regions that
bind SH3 domains, and phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine that can also
mediate binding with proteins containing SH2 or PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domains
[52]. Such interactions could serve as scaffolding functions in assembly of the actinomyosin
complexes that form the contractile ring or in associations with the mitotic spindle that
determine the cleavage plane.
Although several Rho regulators and effectors are involved in cytokinesis [3,13,15], the
signaling pathway(s) related to this process are not completely defined. An emerging model
suggests that localization and activation of RhoA during cytokinesis is regulated by the ECT2-
centraspindlin complex [26,27,30]. Both positive and negative regulation of Rho are necessary,
since CF assembly and ring contraction are dynamic processes [53]. Several models have
suggested that cytokinesis is initiated by activation of Rho at the site of CF assembly and
terminated by inactivation of Rho, presupposing that Rho activation and inactivation are
temporally uncoupled. However, recent studies, including the findings in this paper, support
the concept that Rho’s GTPase cycle undergoes rapid and repetitive turnover during the entire
process of cytokinesis and that this cycling is necessary for normal cytokinesis [28,54]. This
model implies that both RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs are highly activated and remain associated
with the Rho activation zone at the CF. It is well established that ECT2 localizes to the CF and
is a positive regulator of Rho in cytokinesis. The following evidence suggests that
p190RhoGAP is a strong candidate for fulfilling the negative regulatory role. First, the GAP
activity of p190 is specific for Rho in vivo, as compared to Rac and Cdc42 [42]. Second, p190’s
involvement in cytokinesis is GAP domain-dependent [41], and a dominant negative GAP-
domain mutant enhances Rho activity at the CF above that of control, suggesting that measured
negative regulation of Rho activity is mediated during cytokinesis by p190 (Fig. 4). Third,
p190 localizes to the CF and co-localizes with Rho throughout the entire process of cytokinesis
(Fig. 2). Fourth, FRET analysis demonstrated that p190 reduces Rho activity at the CF, that
this reduction is dependent on the dose of p190, and that reduced Rho activity correlates with
aberrant localization of the cleavage plane (Figs. 3–5). Lastly, p190 and ECT2 are physically
associated during mitosis [55]. Together, these data strongly support p190 as an upstream
negative regulator of Rho activity during cytokinesis.
Our findings regarding the spatio-temporal regulation of Rho activity during cytokinesis are
consistent with other studies in which alternative probes and cell types were used to follow

activated Rho. Bement et al. (2005) utilized an eGFP-conjugated Rhotekin Binding Domain
(eGFP-RBD) construct to explore the active pool of Rho GTPases in sea urchin and frog
embryos [22]. They found that the eGFP-RBD concentrated at the equator of blastomeres in
narrow zones that coincided with the sites of furrow formation and that these zones contracted
in synchrony with ingressing CFs. Yuce et al. (2005) transfected YFP-tagged, full-length C.
elegans RhoA (Ce-Rho) into HeLa cells, and like eGFP-RBD in sea urchin and frog embryos,
found that CeRhoA accumulated at sites of furrow initiation early in anaphase, a concentration
that was sustained in the CF throughout ring contraction [26]. A similar localization of
endogenous RhoA was found in trichloroacetic acid-fixed HeLa cells stained with specific
RhoA antibodies [26]. However, using a single chain Rho FRET probe, designed differently
than the one used in the current study, Yoshizaki et al (2003) found that RhoGTP levels
increased only at the end of cytokinesis [31], suggesting that activated Rho does not play a
significant role in cleavage plane specification or contractile ring assembly and contraction. In
contrast to this study, we show that Rho activity increases at the equatorial region before and
during CF contraction. The discrepancies between these studies might be due to the different
biosensor constructs or the sensitivity of the detection systems. Also, unlike the biosensor used
in Yoshizaki et al (2003), the biosensor used here is subject to normal regulation by GDI and
has been used to study Rho activity in situ in both interphase cells and cells undergoing
cytokinesis [32,33].
Our data clearly suggest that overexpression of p190 affects specification of the CF through
inhibition of Rho activity at the potential CF. It is generally agreed that anaphase spindle
microtubules define the furrow position. In addition to regulating actin dynamics, Rho has been
shown to regulate microtubules through its substrates, formin-homology proteins [56,57]. Live
cell FRET imaging (Fig. 5) showed a concentration of active Rho at potential cleavage sites,
but it is not clear whether this effect is mediated through p190 directly or indirectly through
Rho, or whether the effect is on microtubules or actin. Such questions warrant further
investigation.
In summary, the results in this paper suggest that active Rho accumulates at the cell equator
in early anaphase before ring contraction and remains in the activated state throughout
cytokinesis. Overexpression of p190 results in dose-dependent downregulation of Rho activity
at the CF, thereby altering the dynamics of cleavage plane specification and furrow contraction.
Endogenous p190 co-localizes with Rho throughout cytokinesis. From these results, we
postulate that p190 acts as a negative regulator of Rho during cytokinesis in juxtaposition to
RhoGEFs to ensure normal progression through cytokinesis.
