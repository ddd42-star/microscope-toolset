Abstract 11 
Tightly regulated spatio -temporal Rho GTPase activity patterns regulate morphogenetic 12 
processes such as cell migration. Emerging evidence suggests that binding of Guanine 13 
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) a nd GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to the 14 
cytoskeleton or adhesions mediate feedback regulation to spatio -temporal Rho GTPase 15 
activation. To explore such feedback regulation, we study the Rho specific GAP Deleted in 16 
Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) which binds to f ocal adhesions (FAs) through mechanosensitive 17 
interactions. Using a FRET biosensor, we show that DLC1 loss of function leads to global 18 
increase in Rho activity and contractility throughout the cell without affecting a striking 19 
lamellar RhoA activity band i n fibroblasts. To interrogate the Rho GTPase signaling flux, 20 
we build a genetic circuit consisting of an optogenetic actuator to control Rho activity, and 21 
a Rho activity biosensor. In spreading cells at steady state, optogenetic manipulation of 22 
Rho activity reveals that DLC1 controls the rate of Rho activation rather than duration, both 23 
at FAs and at the plasma membrane (PM). Local and reversible optogenetic control of 24 
contractility shows that DLC1 associates/dissociates with FAs during their 25 
reinforcement/relaxation. This might provide positive feedback that locally increases the 26 
rate of Rho activation at FAs that experience local tension to facilitate FA disassembly. Our 27 
results indicate that DLC1 operates both at the PM and at FAs to regulate global Rho 28 
activity levels at steady state, or to amplify local Rho activity at FAs experiencing a strong 29 
mechanical input, presumably to induce robust FA disassembly. This provides new insights 30 
in the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling. 31

Introduction 33 
Rho GTPases regulate the cytoskeletal dynamics that power morphogenetic processes at 34 
the cell - and tissue level  (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002) . Their activity is tightly 35 
controlled in time and space by G EFs and GAPs, which respectively activate and inhibit 36 
Rho GTPases. In the GTP-loaded, active state, Rho GTPases bind downstream effectors 37 
that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and other cellular processes. Based on classic 38 
experiments that include measuring population-averaged Rho GTPase activity levels, as 39 
well as overexpressing dominant positive/negative Rho GTPase mutants, it was proposed 40 
that Rac1 controls lamellipodial protrusion, Cdc42 regulates filopodium formation, and 41 
RhoA controls myosin-based contractility.  42 
Recent studies in which spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activation dynamics were measured 43 
using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors, revealed a much 44 
higher signaling complexity. During cell migration, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 are all activated 45 
in membrane protrusions at the leading edge (Itoh et al., 2002; Kraynov et al., 2000; 46 
Nalbant et al., 2004; Pertz et al., 2006) . Further, the three Rho GTPases are activated in 47 
specific spatio-temporal sequences during the protrusion/retraction cycles that fluctuate on 48 
time and length scales of seconds and single micrometers (Machacek et al., 2009) . A 49 
further level of complexity is that these Rho GTPase activity sequences vary depending on 50 
the cell system (Hu et al., 2022; Machacek et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2016). This indicates 51 
that complex spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling programs regulate processes such as 52 
cell migration. Similarly as for Ras GTPases (Schmick et al., 2015) , it is now clear that 53 
these Rho GTPase signaling patterns most likely result from a precise spatio -temporal 54 
regulation of Rho GTPase signaling fluxes controlled by GEFs and GAPs (Bement and von 55 
Dassow, 2014; Fritz and Pertz, 2016; Pertz, 2010). In this signaling flux, specific GEFs will 56 
be locally activated to load Rho GTPases with GTP depending on different cellular inputs. 57 
These GTP-loaded GTPases will then subsequently diffuse in the plasma membrane  by 58 
virtue of their C -terminal lipid moiety until they encounter a locally activated GAP  which 59 
eventually deactivates them. The interplay of GEFs, GAPs and diffusion of Rho GTPases 60 
in the PM will ultimately lead to the formation of a Rho GTPase activity pattern. Modelling 61 
studies have suggested that sophisticated dynamic signaling behaviors can emerge from 62 
the interplay of GEFs, GAPs, and GTPases within a signaling  network (Tsyganov et al., 63 
2012). Steady-state images of Rho GTPase activity  patterns do not provide information 64 
about the whole Rho GTPase flux mentioned above. 65 
This signaling complexity is consistent with the large amount of GEFs and GAPs that are 66 
ubiquitously expressed in cells (Fusco et al., 2016, 2016; Moon and Zheng, 2003; 67 
Mosaddeghzadeh and Ahmadian, 2021; Müller et al., 2020; Rossman et al., 2005) . 68 
Recently, a system-wide screen has revealed that many GEFs and GAPS localize to 69 
cytoskeletal structures as well as adhesion complexes such as focal adhesions (FAs)  70

(Müller et al., 2020). This strongly suggests the existence  of feedback mechanisms from 71 
the cytoskeleton and FAs to Rho GTPase signaling. In this study, it was shown that Rac1-72 
specific GEFs bind to FAs at the front, while Rac1 -specific GAPs bind to FAs and at the 73 
back of the lamella of fibroblasts. This precise, asymmetric positioning of GEFs and GAPs 74 
might then regulate the Rho GTPase flux that produces the wide gradie nt of Rac activity 75 
observed at the leading edge of fibroblasts (Itoh et al., 2002; Kraynov et al., 2000; Martin 76 
et al., 2016). Such feedback regulation might allow leading edge Rac1 activity to constantly 77 
integrate mechanosensitive inputs from FAs, allowing dynamic regulation of Rac1 activity 78 
required to fine tune cell migration. Another prominent example of such spatio -temporal 79 
feedback regulation are the excitable RhoA activity patterns observed in the cortex during 80 
cytokinesis in Xenopus Laevis (Bement and von Dassow, 2014) , that have also been 81 
observed in mammalian cells (Graessl et al., 2017). Here, RhoA activity waves that control 82 
F-actin wave patterns are spatially regulated by a RhoGAP that is locally regulated by F -83 
actin (Bement et al., 2015a). Thus, cytoskeletal feedback to Rho GTPase regulation might 84 
be crucial to generate dynamic Rho GTPase signaling patterns. Understanding such 85 
spatio-temporal feedback regulation is not accessible with classic genetic approaches in 86 
which long term perturbation of Rho GTPases, their regulators and effectors rapidly result 87 
in a new mechanochemical state of the cell, that will not be informative about an initial 88 
signaling/mechanical state of interest (Isogai and Danuser, 2018) . Further, it is currently 89 
unknown which specific features of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling are regulated 90 
to produce signaling patterns. For example, does negative regulation by a GAP solel y 91 
control Rho GTPase signal termination, or could it also modulate, less intuitive parameters 92 
such as the rate of activation? Tackling such questions requires new tools to acutely and 93 
transiently perturb the Rho GTPase flux to understand its spatio -temporal regulation , 94 
directly in single living cells.  Note that this experimental paradigm was succes sful at 95 
analyzing the Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK network) (Blum et al., 2019; 96 
Dessauges et al., 2022; Ryu et al., 2015). 97 
A promising candidate to investigate how mechanical feedback from FAs can spatio -98 
temporally shape Rho GTPase activity is the RhoA-specific GAP Deleted in Liver Cancer 99 
1 (DLC1). DLC1 has been shown to both bind the plasma membrane (PM) (Erlmann et al., 100 
2009), as well as FAs (Haining et al., 2018; Kaushik et al., 2014) . At the PM, intera ction 101 
with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) can regulate GAP activity (Erlmann 102 
et al., 2009). At the FA, DLC1 interacts with the r7-r8 domains of the FA protein talin in a 103 
mechanosensitive fashion (Gingras et al., 2008; Goult et al., 2021; Haining et al., 2018; 104 
Zhao et al., 2022), as well as with Focal adhesion kinase (Li et al., 2011). When talin is in 105 
a state of low mechanical strain, it binds to DLC1, and presumably leads to local RhoA 106 
inactivation. However, upon force application, the r7 -r8 domains unfold leading to 107 
dissociation of DLC1 from talin, leading to loss of negative RhoA regulation. This suggests 108 
that DLC1 is regulated at FAs by mechanosensitive interactions, which can relay 109 
information about the mechanical state of the cell to control RhoA activity. 110

In this work, we explore the spatio-temporal regulation of RhoA activity by DLC1. We show 111 
that knocking out DLC1 in REF52 fibroblasts leads to increased amplitude in RhoA 112 
throughout the cell. This is accompanied by an increased contractility that augments FAs 113 
and stress fibers (SFs). To explore how DLC1 contributes to Rho GTPase activity fluxes, 114 
we built a genetic circuit consisting of an optogenetic actuator to activate Rho with light, 115 
and a spectrally compatible biosensor to measure Rho activity. Transient optogenetic 116 
recruitment of a Rho GEF domain at FAs or at the PM led to an increase in the rate of 117 
activation of Rho in DLC1 KO versus WT cells at both subcellular localizations. However, 118 
we found that in both control and DLC1 null cells, RhoA activation was more efficient at 119 
FAs compared to the PM . Further, acute and local  manipulation of contractility with the 120 
optogenetic actuator  revealed that DLC1 dynamically associates/dissociates with FAs 121 
under acute mechanical tension/relaxation. Our results suggest a complex mechanism in 122 
which DLC1 -dependent Rho regulation can occur both at the PM and at FAs, with a 123 
dependence on mechanosensitive signals on the latter. 124 
 125 
Results 126 
DLC1 deficient cells show increased formation of SFs and FAs 127 
To investigate the function of DLC1 in cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics, we knocked 128 
down (KD) DLC1 in rat REF52 fibroblasts via small interfering RNA (siRNA). We also 129 
created a knockout (KO) cell line via Crispr/Cas9, that has a frameshift deletion at position 130 
841 of Exon 5 of the gene, resulting in an early in frame stop codon 100 bp downstream of 131 
the cut. Gene-editing was validated by sequencing the endogenous locus. We were unable 132 
to test expression levels using western blot because of the absence of commercially 133 
available antibodies specific for rat DLC1. We then also rescued the DLC1 KO cells with 134 
an mCherry-labeled DLC1 construct using stable transfection with a piggyBac transposase 135 
system. REF52 fibroblasts were seeded at subconfluent density onto fibronectin -coated 136 
glass bottom wells  and allowed to spread for one hour before fixation, leading to an 137 
isotropic spreading state in control, wild -type (WT) cells. To assess the impact of DLC1 138 
deficiency on the formation of cytoskeletal and adhesion structures, we stained for F-actin 139 
(phalloidin) and paxillin (Figure 1A) or phospho -myosin light chain (pMLC) (Figure 1B). 140 
Consistent with a n expected increase in RhoA activity, we observed a phenotype of 141 
increased contractility as documented by increased lamella size, SF content, number of 142 
FAs, an d increased pMLC. This increased contractility led to the loss of the isotropic 143 
spreading observed in WT cells. Rescue with the DLC1 construct reverted the cells to a 144 
less contractile phenotype that displayed a lamella of identical size as WT cells, enabling 145 
the characteristic isotropic spreading observed in WT cells. Quantification of these images 146 
revealed both an increase in lamella size (Figure 1C) and FA area (Figure 1D) in DLC1 KD 147 
and KO cells versus WT and rescue cells ( Figure1C). As previously documented in 148

fibroblasts (Kaushik et al., 2014), these results indicate that DLC1 feeds into the regulation 149 
of contractility, SF and FA formation in fibroblasts. The less penetrant phenotype observed 150 
in KO versus KD suggests that the KO cells might be able to adapt to the long-term absence 151 
of DLC1, while KD cells h ad less than 48 hours to adjust to the new mechanical 152 
state. These experiments also validate the DLC1 KO cells and DLC1 KO rescued with 153 
mCherry-DLC1 that will be used in subsequent experiments. 154 
 155 
DLC1 deficient cells display altered spreading dynamics, lack of polarization 156 
and efficient migration 157 
We timelapsed REF52 WT and DLC1 KO cells for multiple hours in presence of pla telet 158 
derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent stimulator of fibroblast motility (Martin et al., 2014), 159 
and evaluated their ability to migrate. We found that DLC1 KO cells displayed a reduction 160 
in both their speed of migration and their ability to migrate directionally (Figure S1A-C). We 161 
then investigated cytoskeletal dynamics during spreading using REF52 fibroblasts stably 162 
expressing the F-actin marker LifeAct (Riedl et al., 2008). Imaging early spreading (e.g. 20 163 
minutes after plating) revealed no clear differences in edge dynamics in WT versus DLC1 164 
KO cells (Figure 2A). However, kymograph analysis clearly showed that the lamella that 165 
characteristically starts directly at the leading edge of the highly contractile REF52 cells 166 
(Martin et al., 2016, 2014) , was wider in DLC1 KO versus WT cells. Later, 1 hour after 167 
plating, when the cells are still spreading, lamellipodial protrusion/retraction cycles of wider 168 
amplitude were observed in DLC1 KO versus WT cells (Figure 2B, Movie S1), with again 169 
a large increase in SF content (F igure 2B, right panel). After initial spreading, REF52 170 
fibroblasts break their symmetry and eventually display  short episodes of polarized cell 171 
migration. Later, contractility builds up leading cells with spindle -like morphology. This 172 
process occurs on tim escales of multiple hours. To capture these behaviors, we  173 
investigated cytoskeletal dynamics over the next 10 hours after reseeding at a slower 174 
timescale that precludes observation of lamellipodial dynamics. While WT cells efficiently 175 
broke their symmetry, and could display short stretches of polarized migration, DLC1 KO 176 
cells displayed robust stress fibers that hampered symmetry breaking and polarization 177 
(Figure 2C, Movie S2 ). DLC1 KO cells therefore rapidly adopted a spindle -like shape. 178 
Quantification of the adoption of such a spindle shape phenotype showed that WT cells will 179 
assume the spindle -like shape much later than DLC1 KO cells and often fail to do so 180 
entirely within the 10 hours of imaging (Figure 2D). Further highlighting a role for DLC1 in 181 
RhoA-mediated control of contractility, we found that DLC1 overexpression leads to strong 182 
reduction in the number of SFs (Figure S2A). Together, these results show that DLC1 loss 183 
of function leads to increased contractility at the onset of spreading, which later impedes 184 
polarization and directional cell migration. 185

DLC1 deficient cells display an increase in global RhoA activity, without any 187 
marked differences in RhoA activity pattern 188 
To explore how DLC1 spatio-temporally controls RhoA activity, we used RhoA2G (Fritz et 189 
al., 2013), a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor that reports 190 
on RhoA activity together with the Lifeact F -actin marker during spreading. As previously 191 
observed (Martin et al., 2014) , a RhoA activity band that correlates with the lamella r 192 
contractile actomyosin network of the cell can be observed at the cell edge of WT REF52 193 
fibroblast (Figure 3A, Movie S3). In DLC1 KO cells, we observed global elevation of RhoA 194 
activity throughout the cell. Quantification of both the average activity per cell and the local 195 
edge RhoA activity  revealed increased RhoA activity (Figure 3B). Kymograph analysis 196 
revealed that the lamellar RhoA activity band remained of constant size during spreading 197 
(Figure 3A). Examining cells approximately 10 hours  after spreading when they had fully 198 
spread, and WT cells had adopted a more contractile state, the DLC1 KO cells still exhibited 199 
a global increase in RhoA activity  (Figure 3C,D). This increase was however less strong 200 
than in spreading cells, most likely b ecause of a higher state of contractility in WT well -201 
spread versus spreading cells. We also evaluated the effect of overexpression of an 202 
mCherry-tagged DLC1 on RhoA activity (Figure S2B). We observed that mild DLC1 203 
expression, that remains mostly bound to FAs and to the PM  and does not compromise 204 
cell morphology, leads to a decrease in global RhoA activity. Strong DLC1 expression that 205 
leads to a large cytosolic pool of DLC1 further diminishes global RhoA activity but then 206 
compromises cell morphology. Together, these results suggest that DLC1 signaling at the 207 
PM and at FAs  controls global levels of RhoA activity within cells, rather than controlling 208 
the spatio-temporal RhoA activity pool observed at the lamella. 209 
 210 
Design of an optogenetic actuator - Rho biosensor to interrogate the Rho 211 
GTPase flux 212 
While FRET measurements as shown above provide insight about a steady -state RhoA 213 
activity pattern, they cannot probe in detail how  a GEF/GAP/GTPase signaling network  214 
might affect the Rho GTPase flux which most likely emerges from the regulation of multiple 215 
GEFs and GAPs. For example, GAP -mediated negative regulation  might control Rho 216 
GTPase signal duration, but might also be involved in adjusting the rate of activation. We 217 
reasoned that transient, acute optogenetic perturbations of the Rho GTPase flux, followed 218 
by measuring Rho activity dynamics might provide new insights about its regulation. To 219 
manipulate Rho activity in single living cells, we re-engineered an iLID-based optogenetic 220 
actuator based on a DH/PH domain of the GEF LARG (Oakes et al., 2017) (Figure 4A). We 221 
used a high affinity nano SspB domain for efficient light-dependent recruitment of the LARG 222 
GEF domain to the iLID anchor. To better focus optogenetic activation, we also fused the 223 
iLID anchor to a stargazin membrane anchor that slows down its diffusion (Natwick and 224

Collins, 2021) . Both the stargazin -iLID anchor and the SspB -LARG domains were 225 
separated by a P2A self-cleaving peptide, allowing for equimolar expression of both units 226 
from a single operon. We refer to this construct as optoLARG. To interrogate the Rho 227 
GTPase flux, we engineered a REF52 line that stably expressed the optogenetic construct 228 
as well as a rhotekin-based G protein binding domain (rGBD) that reports on Rho activation 229 
(Mahlandt et al., 2021) . The rGBD probe is labelled with a  tandem dimeric Tomato 230 
(tdTomato) fluorophore that is spectrally orthogonal to optogenetic activation . We used a 231 
truncated CMV promoter to warrant low expression level of the rGBD probe to avoid 232 
dominant negative effects of the construct through inh ibition of Rho signaling.  We also 233 
expressed a spectrally orthogonal far-red Lifeact-miRFP construct that reports on F-actin 234 
dynamics. Because rGBD cannot distinguish between the activity of the RhoA, RhoB and 235 
RhoC isoforms, we refer to any rGBD measurement  as Rho activity.  This is in marked 236 
contrast with RhoA2G, the FRET biosensor we used above that is specific for RhoA (Fritz 237 
et al., 2013), but is not spectrally compatible with optoLARG. Note that both biosensors are 238 
able to measure active Rho GTPase pools during  robust morphogenetic events such as  239 
tail retraction (Fritz et al., 2013; Mahlandt et al., 2021) , while rGBD misses leading edge 240 
Rho GTPase activity pools widely observed using FRET probes (Machacek et al., 2009; 241 
Martin et al., 2016; Pertz et al., 2006). 242 
We then used a digital micromirror device (DMD) to spatially shine repetitive pulses of blue 243 
light delivered at different frequencies on 2 distinct regions of interest (ROIs) at the edge 244 
of fibroblasts. When light pulses were delivered at high frequency, we observed robust Rho 245 
activation at the edge, which correlated with assembly of contractile F-actin structures and 246 
potent edge retraction (Figure 4B, kymograph shown in 4C , Movie S4 ). Removal of the 247 
blue light pulses led to a subsequent decrease in Rho activity, and reversion of the edge 248 
to a protrusive state. Further, stimulating a ROI at the opposite edge of the cell with a lower 249 
light pulse frequency led to a lower Rho activation, and less robust edge retraction. These 250 
results indicate that  depending on the strength of the light input,  optoLARG can locally, 251 
reversibly, and quantitatively control Rho activity in singl e living cells on timescales of 252 
seconds, allowing us to acutely manipulate the Rho GTPase flux. 253 
 254 
Optogenetic interrogation of the Rho GTPase flux in WT and DLC1 KO cells 255 
Because DLC1 might both regulate the Rho GTPase flux both at the PM (Erlmann et al., 256 
2009) and at FAs (Haining et al., 2018) , we performed a series of experiments using 257 
optoLARG to transiently activate RhoA with the expectation of observing  different 258 
perturbations in Rho activity fluxes in control versus DLC1 KO cells. For that purpose, we 259 
produced WT and DLC1 KO REF52 lines expressing optoLARG, the tdTomato -rGBD 260 
biosensor and miRFP-paxillin as a readout for focal adhesions . We first sought to locally 261 
activate RhoA by illuminating large ROIs at edges and evaluate any difference in Rho 262

activity patterns using the spectrally compatible rGBD biosensor in WT versus DLC1 KO 263 
cells. We however were not able to identify a threshold optogenetic light input that would 264 
induce different RhoA activity  patterns and edge dynamics in WT versus the more 265 
contractile DLC1 KO cells. We observed that t he same light input  could induce edge 266 
retraction in both WT and DLC1 KO cells in a non-predictable manner. This might be due 267 
to the spatial heterogeneity of the mechanical states within cells, as well as small 268 
differences in optoLARG and rGBD expression levels in the stable cell lines.  To address 269 
this caveat, we reasoned that we should activate Rho using optoLARG with a more subtle 270 
modality by illuminating only small ROIs and measuring small local fluctuations of Rho 271 
activity using rGBD without inducing large changes in mechanical states. Further, to dissect 272 
potential regulation of DLC1 GAP activity by PI(4,5)P2 at the PM  (Erlmann et al., 2009)  273 
versus mechanosensitive interactions at the FA (Haining et al., 2018), we decided to make 274 
measurements on FAs but use ROIs outside of FAs (non-FAs ROIs) to probe the PM. For 275 
that purpose, we built an image analysis pipeline to first segment a cell in a field of view 276 
and to then segment FAs based on their fluorescent intensity, size and localization at the 277 
cell periphery  using the paxillin -miRFP signal (Figure 5A). We then used these FA 278 
segmentations to illuminate small ROIs within FAs or in neighboring non-FA ROIs with one 279 
pulse of blue light using the DMD and evaluated rGBD fluorescence fluctuations at this 280 
location for a couple of minutes until Rho activity returned to baseline ( Figure 5B). This 281 
optogenetic stimulation had no visible effect on edge retraction, or FA morphodynamics, 282 
as observed when stimulating larger ROIs. Quality control of our automated segmentation 283 
revealed high versus low paxillin signals in FA versus non -FA ROIs ( Figure 5C). This 284 
experiment was performed on multiple cells, allowing to average out any experimental 285 
noise due to small differences in expression levels of optoLARG or rGBD. These data were 286 
then averaged for FA and non-FA ROIs. We observed that this pulsed optoLARG light input 287 
led to a local transient of Rho activity for approximately 2.5 minutes in WT cells when FAs 288 
or the PM were stimulated (Figure 5D). The identical optoLARG input led to an increased 289 
rate of Rho activation leading to higher amplitude when a FA versus a non-FA ROI was 290 
stimulated. Surprisingly, in DLC1 KO cells, we observed increased Rho activation rate that 291 
also led to augmented Rho activity amplitude in comparison with WT cells in both FA and 292 
non-FA ROIs. This was also accompanied with faster deactivation kinetics of RhoA. These 293 
data suggest that  DLC1 limits the rate of Rho activation rather than signal duration to 294 
regulate RhoA activity in spread cells. This can occur both at the PM and at FAs. Further, 295 
FAs seem to provide a subcellular environment that favors GEF-mediated activation of Rho 296 
activity. The finding that DLC1 KO also leads to faster deactivation suggests the existence 297 
of a negative feedback that points to complex modalities of spatio-temporal regulation that 298 
most likely involves additional GEFs/GAPs. 299

Our finding that we did not observe striking patterns of RhoA activity in the vicinity of FAs 302 
in spread cells challenges the idea that mechan ical inputs regulate Rho activity in this 303 
specific regime of mechanical forces. We speculated that the DLC1/talin system in FAs is 304 
only mechanosensitive to stronger mechanical inputs. To evaluate FA-DLC1 interactions, 305 
we imaged fibroblasts rescued with mCherry -DLC1 and miRFP -paxillin as a marker for 306 
FAs. We observed that DLC1 binds to FAs at the onset of FA assembly, and that the local 307 
DLC1 density augmented with the paxillin density (Figure S3A-C). During FA disassembly, 308 
DLC1 density diminished concomitantly with decreasing paxillin density until the FA was 309 
fully disassembled (Figure S3D-F). 310 
To characterize force-dependent interactions of FAs with DLC1  in regimes of strong 311 
mechanical perturbations, we engineered our mCherry-DLC1 rescue cells to stably express 312 
the optoLARG system, as well as the miRFP-paxillin construct. We then used the DMD to 313 
activate Rho-mediated contractility locally and transiently in small ROIs containing FAs with 314 
a standardized light input. The transient light pulse induced either of the two FA behaviors: 315 
light-mediated FA reinforcement as evidenced by a local increase in paxillin density,  was 316 
followed by 1. FA relaxation (and decrease in paxillin density) upon light removal (Figure 317 
6A-C, quantified in Figure 6D , Movie S5) , or 2. FA rupture (Figure S4A-C). This was 318 
accompanied by a striking simultaneous decrease in DLC1 intensity at the FA during FA 319 
reinforcement, and a reassociation of DLC1 during FA relaxation upon light input removal. 320 
If the light input led to FA rupture, then the DLC1 signal gradually decreased along FA 321 
reinforcement until the FA ultimately ruptured in an all-or-nothing manner. FAs in the same 322 
cell that were not subjected to the light input displayed dynamics as in normal cells , as 323 
shown in Figure 6 (Figure S 4D-F). These results indicate that DLC1 dynamically 324 
dissociates and associates during acute FA reinforcement and relaxation in response to a 325 
strong mechanical input. 326 
 327 
Discussion 328 
A key question in Rho GTPase biology is how multiple GEFs and GAPs control  spatio-329 
temporal Rho GTPase signaling patterns to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics that power 330 
morphogenetic processes such as cell migration. The recent finding that many GEFs and 331 
GAPs themselves bind cytoskeletal and adhesion structures (Müller et al., 2020) strongly 332 
suggests direct feedback from the cytoskeleton to Rho GTPase signaling . Self-333 
organizational properties of cytoskeletal and adhesions structures might therefore 334 
contribute to spatio-temporal control of Rho GTPase signaling.  Because DLC1 has been 335 
proposed to bind to FAs in a mechanosensitive manner (Haining et al., 2018), we decided 336 
to study it as a prototypical example of an adhesion feedback to Rho GTPase signaling. 337 
Using novel technologies  that allow for acute spatio -temporal perturbations, we provide 338

some new insights about how Rho GTPases are spatio-temporally controlled by a RhoGAP 339 
that integrates mechanosensitive inputs. 340 
We found that in spreading fibroblasts, DLC1 KO globally augment s contractility, as 341 
illustrated by a robust increase in SFs and FAs (Figure 1). Evaluation of F-actin dynamics 342 
immediately after spreading, when global contractility levels are still low, reveal that DLC1 343 
KO fibroblasts rapidly assemble a wider contractile lamella than WT cells , suggesting 344 
aberrant increase of myosin -based contractility already at an early stage of spreading  345 
(Figure 2A). One hour after cell plating, when cells are well spread but still retain an 346 
isotropic shape, we observed a global increase in contractility in DLC1 KO versus WT cells 347 
(Figure 3B). On a timescale of multiple hours after spreading , when WT cells break 348 
symmetry, display polarized cell migration episodes , and finally adopt a contractile state  349 
leading to a spindle morphology, we find that DLC1 KO cells transition directly to the 350 
contractile phenotype without being able to polarize (Figure 2C,D). Thus, DLC1 loss of 351 
function leads to a global increase of aberrant contractility. 352 
We had previously shown that REF52 fibroblasts display a wide band of RhoA activity that 353 
correlates with the lamellar contractile myosin network during spreading (Martin et al., 354 
2016, 2014). We found that DLC1 KO leads to a global increase in RhoA activity throughout 355 
the cell, without however markedly modifying the spatial band of RhoA activity (Figure 356 
3A,B). Similar results were observed when cells were allowed to further polarize and 357 
assemble a robust actomyosin cytoskeleton (Figure 3C,D). Further, we observed that mild 358 
DLC1 expression, that can still mostly be titrated by FAs  and the PM without spilling out 359 
into the cytosol, is already able to strongly downregulate global RhoA activity levels (Figure 360 
S2B). We propose that DLC1 regulates global levels of RhoA activity at steady state, rather 361 
than spatially patterned RhoA activity pools as observed in protrusive edges and filopodia 362 
(Fritz et al., 2013; Machacek et al., 2009; Pertz et al., 2006) , in the lamella (Martin et al., 363 
2016, 2014) or at the cytokinetic furrow (Basant and Glotzer, 2018; Bement et al., 2015b). 364 
Note that the classic genetic perturbation paradigm cannot be used to study more subtle 365 
functions of DLC1 at FAs because long -term loss of DLC1 function results in cells being 366 
locked in a state of excessive contractility. 367 
How does DLC1 contribute to the Rho GTPase flux in cells? To answer this question, we 368 
used optoLARG to interrogate the Rho GTPase flux at the PM and at FAs, 2 sites at which 369 
DLC1 can control Rho (Erlmann et al., 2009; Haining et al., 2018) . We 1st found that a 370 
transient optoLARG light input of identical amplitude at FAs led to increased Rho activity 371 
amplitude compared to stimulation in non-FA PM regions (schematized in Figure 6E). This 372 
strongly suggest that the FA is a subcellular region which is highly permissive for GEF-373 
mediated activation of Rho , which could involve a num ber of mechanisms including Src 374 
regulation of Rho release from RhoGDI (DerMardirossian et al., 2006). 2nd, surprisingly, 375 
we observed that DLC1 KO cells displayed increased rates of Rho activation kinetics in 376 
both FA and non-FA regions in response to a transient optoLARG light input, also leading 377

to increased Rho activity amplitude. This strongly suggests that DLC1 regulates the rate of 378 
Rho activation rather than signal duration/termination. Given the promiscuous expression 379 
of GEFs and GAPs within a cell type (Moon and Zheng, 2003; Rossman et al., 2005), other 380 
Rho GAP(s) might specifically control signal termination , which might by example be 381 
important to specifiy the lamellar pattern of RhoA activity in our REF52 cell system . The 382 
role of DLC1 in controlling the rate of Rho activation remains to be understood. One can 383 
however speculate that DLC1 provides negative feedback  to control the rate of Rho 384 
activation. Such feedback structures are prevalent in different GTPase signaling networks 385 
(Tsyganov et al., 2012; Wu and Lew, 2013), and can endow the latter with properties such 386 
as robustness to perturbations. 3rd, we observed that in addition to the increased rate of 387 
Rho activation in response to the optoLARG input, DLC1 KO cells also display faster 388 
adaptation back to baseline Rho activity compared to  control cells. Such non -linear 389 
behavior again suggests the existence of additional feedback regulation that might involve 390 
other GEFs/GAPs. An important feature of our optogenetic approach in which we perturb 391 
cells minimally without eliciting cytoskeletal responses is that we might be able to capture 392 
subtle dynamic processes occurring at steady state. Strong optoLARG input that leads to 393 
robust actomyosin contractility  and edge retraction , as seen in Figure 4, might activate 394 
numerous mechanical feedback not present at steady-state, and thus not provide access 395 
to cellular regulation processes occurring in an unperturbed, normal state. 396 
Together, our data strongly suggests that in spread fibroblasts at steady state, in absence 397 
of any acute mechanical input, DLC1 can exert its GAP activity both at the PM and at FAs 398 
to control the rate of Rho activation. In these conditions, DLC1 association with FAs follows 399 
FA assembly and disassembly (Figure 6 ), strongly suggesting that mechanosensitive 400 
interactions with talin are not relevant in this context (Haining et al., 2018). Note that RhoA 401 
localization is homogeneously distributed at the PM, and any RhoA pool being regulated 402 
by DLC1 at the FAs will immediately diffuse in the PM, explaining the absence of local 403 
pools of RhoA activity at FAs. This global regulation of R hoA activity levels by DLC1 in 404 
fibroblasts is in marked contrast with neuronal growth cones, in which DLC1 regulates a 405 
highly focused RhoA activity pattern that localizes to the tip of F-actin bundles in filopodia, 406 
most probably to regulat e formin-dependent actin polymerization (Fusco et al., 2016) . In 407 
this context, DLC1 loss of function leads to an enlargement of the RhoA activity pattern at 408 
filopodia, which results in longer and stabler filopodia, ultimately inducing more processive 409 
growth cone motility and neurite outgrowth. This shows that a specific RhoGAP , such as 410 
DLC1, can function in different ways in distinct cellular systems and mechanical contexts. 411 
In the presence of acute mechanical perturbations, we observe distinct DLC1 dynamics at 412 
FAs that most likely involve documented mechanosensitive interactions with talin at FAs 413 
(Haining et al., 2018) . Using optoLARG, we were able to control actomyosin contractility 414 
transiently and locally in a small ROI leading to FA reinforcement followed by relaxation 415 
(Figure 6). We found that in response to such a mechanical input, DLC1 rapidly dissociates 416

from FAs that exhibit robust reinforcement (Figure 6, schematized in Figure 6F ). The 417 
release of DLC1 in response to strong FA reinforcement correlates well with in vitro  418 
measurements that have shown that DLC1 dissociates from stretched talin due to unfolding 419 
of the r7-r8 domain (Haining et al., 2018). Our data also shows that FA relaxation can lead 420 
to rebinding of DLC1 to FAs (Figure 6), suggesting that the r7-r8 talin domain might refold 421 
in these conditions.  Our results illustrate how  optoLARG enables spatio-temporal, 422 
reversible control of contractility that might help unravel mechanosensitive interactions that 423 
are not accessible with classically used global chemical perturbations such as nocodazole-424 
mediated microtubule depolymerization  (Krendel et al., 2002) , or treatment with 425 
lysophosphatidic acid (Pertz et al., 2006)  leading to global RhoA activation and massive 426 
stimulation of contractility. 427 
We propose that DLC1 provides two levels of regulation of Rho. In absence of any strong 428 
mechanical input, active DLC1 at FAs and at the PM throughout the cell seems to contribute 429 
to the regulation of steady -state global Rho activity in the cells by controlling its rate of 430 
activation. The significance of this mode of regulation is yet to be understood but most likely 431 
involves simultaneous regulation with additional Rho GEFs and GAPs. Distinct Rho GAPs 432 
might spatially control signal termination that shape the characteristic band of RhoA activity 433 
that coincides with the lamella.  In response to strong mechanical stimuli  leading to FA 434 
reinforcement and talin stretching , rapid unbinding of DLC1 from FAs might locally 435 
decrease local RhoGAP activity providing positive feedback that could rapidly increase the 436 
local rate of Rho activation , possibly strengthening contractility that might lead to FA 437 
disassembly as we have observed. C onversely, when the mechanical input vanishes, 438 
recruitment of DLC1 to relaxing FAs might rapidly switch off RhoA activity to return to a 439 
steady state of low contractility. We speculate that these non -linear signaling behaviors 440 
might allow to amplify local mechanical input s to regulate all -or-nothing cytoskeletal 441 
processes such as tail retraction during cell migration. Such tail retraction events are 442 
characterized by short bursts of highly localized RhoA activity that are followed by rapid 443 
relaxation once the tail has been retracted (Martin et al., 2014; Pertz et al., 2006) . Here, 444 
SF pulling on FAs at the back of a cell might allow local release of DLC1, rapid increase of 445 
local RhoA activity, leading to strong local contraction and tail retraction . Experimentally 446 
testing this hypothesis in the context of tail retraction  is technically challenging because 447 
long term DLC1 perturbation leads to global contractility that precludes cell polarization, 448 
directional migration and thus tail retraction episodes. This illustrates an important limitation 449 
of the classic genetic perturbation toolkit that ha s been used to study Rho GTPase 450 
signaling. 451 
Our results provide new insights into the complex network circuitry that regulates spatio-452 
temporal Rho GTPase signaling and illustrate how we must tackle this problem. By allowing 453 
for precise and reversible perturbations, signaling optogenetics provide the opportunity to 454 
dissect the spatio -temporal Rho GTPase fluxes that contro l patterns of Rho GTPase 455

Materials and methods  461 
Cell culture 462 
Rat Embryo Fibroblast 52 (REF52) were cultured in Dubelcco’s Modified Eagle Medium 463 
with 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% 4mM L -Glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells 464 
were grown at 37 ºC and 5% CO2.  465 
 466 
SiRNA knockdown 467 
4µl lipofectamine RNAi max was mixed with a total of 500µl of OPTIMEM medium and a 468 
pool of SiRNAs against the gene of interest at a final concentration of 60 nM (SiTools 469 
Biotech). The mix was added to a 6 well plate containing 100000 cells in a 2 ml medium 470 
volume medium. 471 
 472 
CrispR/Cas9 Knockout generation 473 
Two guide sequences targeting DNA within exon 5 of the DLC1 gene were selected using 474 
the CRISPOR tool for predicted high -specificity protospacer adjacent motif target sites in 475 
the rat genome 32 . Two complementary oligos each containing the DLC1 guide sequence 476 
and Bbsl ligation adapter s were synthesized (Microsynth) (sense sequence: 5’ -477 
CACCGAACCGAGAGAGCTACCCGG-3', antisense sequence: 5’ -478 
AAACCCGGGTAGCTCTCTCGGTTC-3’). The guide sequences were annealed and 479 
ligated into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector. REF52 cells were grown in six -well plates to 480 
60% confluency and transfected with 1µg of the vector together with 1 µl of Lipofectamine 481 
3000 and 5 µl of P3000 solution (ThermoFisher Scientific). Two days post transfection cells 482 
were detached, suspended in PBS +1% FBS and sorted into 96 well -plates using 483 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting. After expansion, individual clones were detached and 484 
suspended in the lysis buffer (10mM TRIS, 50mM KCL, 2.5mM MgCl2, 0.45% Tween-20, 485 
0.05% Gelatine, 0.12 mg/ml of proteinase K). The cell solution was frozen at -80 °C and 486 
subsequently kept at 63 °C for one hour. Proteinase K was inactivated by heating the 487 
solution to 95 °C for 15 minutes. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 500bp region 488

PCR and sequenced by Sanger sequencing.  492 
 493 
DNA constructs 494 
A “pB3.0” piggybac vector was created by adapting the pPBbsr2 (Matasci et al., 2011) to 495 
make it smaller in size. pPBbsr2 was digested with AscI and PacI, yielding 3922 bp and 496 
2864 bp fragments. Full size pPBbsr2 was used as template for a PCR with forward primer 497 
5’-TTAGCATTAATTAAGCGGCCGCGTTGCTGGCGTTTTTCC-3’ and reverse prime r 5’-498 
GTGCCTTTACAACTTATGAGTAACCCCGCGCGGACGATT-3’, yielding a 1671bp insert 499 
that was ligated back into the receiving 3922bp part of the digested pPBbsr2 vector, 500 
creating “pB3.0 -BLAST” (Blasticidine resistance). To introduce different resistance 501 
cassettes, we performed an overlap extension PCR with pB3.0 -BLAST as template for 502 
PCR1 (primers A+B) and PCR2 (primers C+D) with the following primers: 503 
primer A: 5’ -AAGGATGCCCAGAAGGTACCCCATTGTATGGGATCTGATCTGGG-3’, 504

CCTTTGAAAAACACGATAATACCACCGGTAAGTCGAGATGCATCGATGA-3’, primer D: 507 
5’-CTCCGCCTTTCTTGGACGTCGGGTTCGAACCGCATTAGT-3’. Primers A and D, the 508 
product of PCR1 and PCR2 were used for fusing the two fragments by PCR. The resulting 509 
PCR product was ligated into the pB3.0 -BLAST vector, digested with Kpn1 and Pst1, by 510 
fusion cloning, yielding a pB3.0-noAB vector with a single Age1 site to introduce antibiotic 511 
resistance cassettes. To produce pB3.0-HYGRO and pB3.0-PURO, PCRs were performed 512 
on template vectors pHygro -PB and pPuro-PB, respectively. For pB3.0 -HYGRO forward 513 
primer 5’ -AACACGATAATACCACCATGAAAAAGCCTGAACTCACCGC-3’ and reverse 514 
primer 515 
5’-GCAGGCTCCCGTTTCCTTATCGGCCATTCAGCTCTA-3’ were used. For pB3.0 -516 
PURO forward primer 5’ -AACACGATAATACCACCATGACCGAGTACAAGCCCACG-3’ 517 
and reverse primer 5’-GCGTTCGGGCCACGGACTGGCCATTCAGCTCTA-3’ were used. 518 
The respective inserts were inserted via fusion cloning in the pB3.0 -noAB vector 33, 519 
digested with AgeI. 520 
Construction of the pB3.0 -optoLARG-mVenus-SspB-p2A-stargazin-mtq2-iLID optoLARG 521 
system was as follows. The cDNA for optoLARG -mVenus-SspB(nano)-p2A-iLID-CAAX 522 
was synthesized by custom gene synthesis (Genewiz, Azenta life sciences, US). The 523 
sequence contained the catalytical DH-PH domain of human RhoGEF12 (LARG, aa 766-524 
1138), connected via a linker (GSGSGSGS) to full -length mVenus fused to SSPB(nano). 525 
This is followed by a p2A sequence (GSGATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP), the iLID module 526 
(Guntas et al., 2015) and a CAAX box (KRAS). The construct was cloned into pB3.0-BLAST 527 
containing a CAG promotor, yielding pB3.0 -optoLARG-mVenus-SspB-p2A-iLID-CAAX. 528

After publication of an improved plasma membrane anchor for the iLID -module (Natwick 529 
and Collins, 2021), we changed the part after the p2A sequence. The pB3.0 -optoLARG-530 
mVenus-SspB-p2A-iLID-CAAX vector was digested with BsrGI and AflII, and a custom 531 
gene synthesized stretch of cDNA containing SspB(nano) -p2A, full -length stargazin, 532 
mTurqoise2 and iLID was ins erted. This yielded pB3.0 -optoLARG-mVenus-SspB(nano)-533 
p2A-stargazin-mtq2-iLID (exact sequences of the gene synthesis products are available on 534 
request).  535 
An eGFP DLC1 plasmid containing the 1091aa long isoform originating from mouse (kindly 536 
provided by Monilola A. Olayioye) was used to produce mCherry -DLC1. The DLC1 gene 537 
was cut out of this plasmid with BamHI and, N -terminally fused to FKBP12-mCherry and 538 
inserted into pB3.0-BLAST containing a CAG-promotor, yielding pB3.0-FKBP12-mCherry-539 
DLC1.  540

Spreading Assay 542 
Glass bottom well plates (Celvis) were coated with 5 µg/ml of human plasma fibronectin 543 
purified protein (Merck) for one hour at room temperature. REF52 cells were seeded at a 544 
density of 7000 cells per well (using 24 well plates) in FluoroBrite DMEM mediu m 545 
containing 1% FBS, 0.1% BSA, 4mM L -Glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 546 
Imaging was done with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with an automatic stage. 547 
Temperature was kept at 37ºC with a temperature control system, humidity (100%) and  548 
CO2 (~5%) with a gas mixer (Life Imaging Services). Focus drift was prevented by the 549 
equipped Perfect Focus System (Nikon). The microscope was controlled with Metamorph 550 
software (Universal Imaging). 551

Optogenetic Stimulation experiments 553 
Glass bottom well p lates (Celvis) were coated with 5 µg/ml of human plasma fibronectin 554 
purified protein (Merck) for one hour at room temperature. REF52 cells were seeded at 555 
6000 cells/well into 12 well plates and allowed to attach for 12 hours. For both RhoA activity 556 
and mCh erry-DLC1/miRFP-paxillin optogenetic stimulation experiments cells were 557 
incubated in FluoroBrite DMEM medium overnight. The microscope was controlled with 558 
NIS-Elements (Nikon) for observing DLC1 dynamics and with open-source micromanager 559 
software (Edelstein et al., 2014) for edge stimulation. Optogenetic stimulation was localized 560 
to specific regions using an Andor mosaic 3 DMD. For mCherry -DLC1/miRFP-paxillin 561 
experiments, ROIs were user-defined. For RhoA activity experiments, cells in different 562 
fields of view were selecte d by a user, cells were then segmented with a custom pixel-563 
classifier based on a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network, which was trained 564

automatically defined at the top and bottom of the cell for consecutive illumination with 566 
different light pulse regimes. Fields of views were imaged one after the other on multiple 567 
cells. For data extraction the stimulation mask was expanded by gaussian smoothing and 568 
then thresholded to cover a wider region, reducing artifacts caused by membrane 569

0.1% Triton X solution was used for permeabilization, after which cells were incubated 575 
overnight at 4C with the blocking buffer, containing 5% Bovine-Serum-Albumin and 0.05% 576 
Tween20 in PBS. After each step of the following protocol cells were washed three times 577 
with Phosphate-Buffered-Saline (PBS). Cells were incubated overnight with the primary 578 
antibody (1:250 dilution for paxillin (Abcam ab32084), 1:50 for pMLC (Cell Signaling 579 
Antibody #3671). Secondary antibody incubation (1:1000) lasted one hour. Phalloidin 580 
incubation (1:200 Phalloidin-Atto647N) was performed for 20 minutes and DAPI incubation 581 
for 10 hours. Cells were imaged immediately after the last step. 582 
 583 
Image analysis 584 
Lamella si ze, focal adhesion areas (Figure 1) and RhoA activity ratio measurements 585 
(Figure 3) were computed with CellProfiler in conjunction with a pixel classifier trained with 586 
Ilastik (Berg et al., 2019). Spreading dynamics (Figure 2D) were manually analyzed. FRET 587 
ratio images were computed and analyzed with custom python scripts. DLC1 and paxillin 588 
dynamics (Figure S3D) were calculated with manually drawn ROIs in Fiji (Schindelin et al., 589 
2012). 590

Figure 1. Cytoskeletal structures in WT and DLC1 deficient cells.  613 
A,B. Representative immunofluorescence images of paxillin and F -actin (phalloidin) (A), 614 
and pMLC and F-actin (phalloidin) (B) immunostains are shown in inverted black and white 615 
(ibw) contrast as well as color composites (DAPI signal also included). Scale bar = 10µm. 616 
C. Compared to WT cells (n=243) lamella size is significantly increased in DLC1 KD cells 617 
(n=290, p-adjusted < 0.001) and DLC1 KO cells (n=242, p-adjusted < 0.001), while DLC1 618 
rescue cells (n=57) show significantly lower lamella sizes than both, WT (p -adjusted = 619 
0.0098), as well as KO cells (p-adjusted < 0.001). 620 
D. DLC1 KD cells (n=290) display a significant increase in the total area of focal adhesions 621 
per cell (p-adjusted <0.001) compared to WT cells (n=243), while DLC1 KO cells (n=242) 622 
do not show a significant difference (p -adjusted = 0.09). Rescue cells show a significant 623 
decrease in the total area of focal adhesions (p -adjusted < 0.001). ANOVA plus Tukey’s 624

All time series are representative ibw contrast images of WT and DLC1 KO cells expressing 629 
Lifeact-mCherry. Dotted lines mark the area used for the kymographs  shown in the right 630 
panels. 631 
A. Cells were imaged for 10 minutes in 10 second intervals during spreading immediately 632 
after replating. Dotted red lines display differences in lamella size in WT and DLC1 KO 633 
cells. Time 634 
B. One hour after reseeding, when cells are still isotropically spreading, DLC1 KO cells 635 
display increased lamellipodia size and more prominent edge protrusion retraction cycles. 636 
High magnification insets are shown for time point 10 minutes and show the robust increase 637 
of contractility in DLC1 KO cells. 638 
C. Cells were imaged for 10 hours with 15 minutes intervals starting from spreading. WT 639 
cells break symmetry and display episodes of polarized motility. KO cells are much less 640 
dynamic and reach a contractile phenotype much faster, without being able to polarize. 641 
D. Box plot showing at which time point cells exhibited the elongated phenotype described 642 
in (C). DLC1 KO cells (n=42) exhibited this phenotype a mean of 90 minutes earlier than 643 
WT cells (n=22) p -adjusted = 0.002, Student's t -test. 17 addit ional WT cells failed to 644 
develop that phenotype entirely. 645

Figure 3. RhoA activation dynamics in WT and DLC1 KO cells 648 
Cells are stably expressing Lifeact -mCherry, and the RhoA2G FRET sensor. RhoA 649 
localization images show RhoA2G localization that is identical to RhoA. RhoA activity 650 
images display the computed FRET ratio. Images are color -coded according to the 651 
normalized scales shown below the panels.  652 
A. Representative images of WT and DLC1 KO cells during spreading. Kymographs for the 653 
violet lines are shown in the right panels. Note the RhoA activity band maintains constant 654 
width during spreading at the periphery in WT cells. Note increased global RhoA activity in 655 
DLC1 KO cells, with maintenance of a similar RhoA band pattern at the cell edge. 656 
B. Box plots of FRET ratio averaged over the whole cell (right panel) or a ROI placed at 657 
the cell edge (left panel). This shows that during spreading DLC1 KO cells (n = 149) have 658 
an increased total RhoA activity compared to WT cells (n = 114, p = 0.005). In addition, the 659 
FRET ratio at just the cell edge is increased as well (p=0.011). 660 
C. Representative images of WT cells and DLC1 KO c ells that have transitioned in a 661 
contractile state 12 hours after plating. No difference in RhoA activity pattern can be 662 
observed between WT and DLC1 KO cells, although the latter still display slightly higher 663 
global RhoA activity levels. 664 
D. Box plots of FRET ratio averaged over the whole cell (right panel) or a ROI placed at 665 
the cell edge (left panel). This shows that contractile DLC1 KO cells (n=103) have an 666 
increased total RhoA activity (p < 0.001) and edge FRET ratio (p < 0.001) compared to WT 667 
cells (n = 82) compared to WT cells (n = 82). Students t-test. 668

GTPase flux 672 
A. Schematics of the optogenetic actuator - Rho biosensor to measure Rho GTPase flux. 673 
OptoLarg is based on an iLID system which does not interact with Ssb -LARG in the dark 674 
state. The iLID module is anchored to the plasma membrane by a Stargazin anchor that 675 
displays slow diffusion, allowing better focussing of optogenetic activation. Upon light 676 
exposure ssb-LARG is locally recruited to the plasma membrane, activating Rho. Rho 677 
activity is measured by a rGBD effector binding domain. 678

B. Time-series of REF52 cells locally stimulated with light first in a ROI at the cell top with 679 
a high stimulation frequency, and then with a ROI at the cell bottom with a low stimulation 680 
frequency. Light pulses have the same intensity. Thick and thin blue thunder symbols 681 
represent high and low optogenetic stimulation. Red dotted line is used for the kymograph 682 
shown in (C).  683 
C. Kymographs of cells in (B). Light pulse stimulation regimes of top and bottom ROIs are 684 
shown in the upper box. Blue dotted boxes indicate the region and length of the stimulation. 685 
Note how intense optogenetic stimulation in the top ROI leads to Rho activity, assembly of 686 
contractile F-actin structures, and robust edge retraction. Upon removal of the light input, 687 
the Rho activity and F-actin resume, and edge protrusion occurs again. Lower optogenetic 688 
stimulation in the bottom ROI leads to much lower Rh o activity and F-actin structures, as 689 
well as lower edge retraction. 690

Figure 5. Rho GTPase activation kinetics in WT versus DLC1 KO cells 693 
A. Computer vision pipeline and experiment: 1) a cell is segmented using the rGBD-dTomato 694 
channel. 2) FAs and non -FAs are detected using the paxillin channel (see Material and 695 
Methods). ROIs on FAs (blue dots, shown in the bottom left panel) and ROIs on non -FA 696 
regions in between (orange dots, shown in the upper left panel) are selected for stimulation. 697 
3) Image of the stimulation pattern (green channel) shows that the calibrated DMD can 698 
stimulate the regions with high spatial precision (image is overexposed to show the 699 
diffraction pattern of the mirrors). 700 
B. The DMD is used to stimulate ROIs (FAs or non-FAs) with a pulse of blue light (blue line). 701 
rGBD signal fluctuations are then measured in the ROIs. 702 
C. Distribution of paxillin -miRFP intensities in the FA and Non -FA ROIs normalized to the 703 
mean paxillin-miRFP intensity of the whole cell shows that our segmentation pipelines 704 
accurately identifies FA and Non-FA ROIs. 705 
D. Normalized and averaged rGBD fluorescence fluctuations upon ROI optogenetic 706 
stimulation. For each stimulated ROIs, the fold change to the baseline (average activity from 707 
0-150 seconds before optogenetic stimulation) is calculated. Median and 99% CI are shown. 708 
Regions on top of focal adhesions have a larger fold change in rGBD activity than regions 709 
between focal adhesions. DLC1-KO cells have a larger rGBD fold change in the initial time 710 
after stimulation (150-200 seconds), but then also fall back down to the baseline quicker. 711 
(KO-FA: N=3643, KO-NON-FA: N=3643, CTRL-FA: N = 2144, CTRL-NON-FA:2144. Mean 712 
number of regions per cell: ~16.90, Cells CTRL = 321, DLC1 -KO=431. The same cell can 713

stimulation regions). 715 
E. The different dynamics described in (D) can be robustly observed in technical replicates 716 
of the experiment. In all replicates the rGBD recruitment is higher in FAs vs Non -FAs, and 717 
we see the trend of faster accumulation and faster return to baseline of rGBD in DLC1 KO 718 
vs CTRL cells. 719

F. Model of force dependent regulation of DLC1 at FAs relevant to this and Figure S3. Left 741 
panel, in absence of acute mechanical input, DLC1 increases with FA assembly and 742 
decreases with FA disassembly. Central panel, upon acute local increase of mechanical 743 
stress in response to application of an optoLARG optogenetic input, DLC1 unbinds from 744 
FA in a reinforcement regime, and rebinds FA in a relaxing regime when the optoLARG 745 
input is removed. Right panel, upon acute local increase of mechanical stress in response 746 
to application of an optoLARG optogenetic input some FAs rupture after DLC1 dissociation 747 
and FA rupture. 748

Supplementary Figure legends  749 
Figure S1: Cell motility properties in WT versus DLC1 KO cells 750 
A. Example fields of view of tracked WT and DLC1 KO cells. 20000 REF fibroblasts 751 
expressing a histone H2B-miRFP marker were seeded in a 24 well-plate well coated with 752 
fibronectin and stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF, imaged for 12 hours at 15 minutes interval. 753 
Tracking was performed using stardist 37 on the H2B image). DLC1 KO cells display a large 754 
subpopulation of cells that remain extremely stationary. 755 
B. Mean Square displacements (MSDs) for different time intervals, WT move more than 756 
DLC1 KO cells for all possible lag times. Plot shows directionality (exponential bit between 757 
0.25 and 1.5 hours). For times longer than 2 hours the curve is flat indicating that migration 758 
has characteristics of random walk at these timescales. Thick lines: mean, thin lines: 759 
standard deviation. Dotted grey line shows delta t chosen for figure C. 760 
C. Distribution of velocities calculated as µm/hour from Root-MSD. We again observe the 761 
bimodal distribution in the DLC1 KO cell with a big subgroup of the cells move extremely 762 
slowly (5 µm/hour). Thick lines are mean and extrema. Two sided t-test: (statistic=25.1, p-763

Figure S2. Effect of DLC1 overexpression on F-actin cytoskeleton and RhoA 766 
activity 767 
A. Effect of DLC1 overexpression of F -actin. REF52 cells stably expressing Lifeact -768 
mCherry were transfected with mCherry-DLC1 or mCherry plasmids, allowed to spread for 769 
12 hours on fibronectin-coated coverslips and imaged. Images are shown in ibw contrast. 770 
Large mCherry-DLC1 pool in the cytosol levels documents its overexpression. Note how 771 
DLC1 overexpression leads to loss of contractile F-actin structures. 772 
B. Effect of DLC1 overexpression of RhoA. Cells stably transfected with the RhoA2G 773 
biosensor were transfected with mCherry-paxillin or mCherry-DLC1. mCherry signals are 774 
shown in ibw contrast. RhoA2G FRET ratio, and expression leve ls are color -coded 775 
according to the scale. Note how low mCherry-DLC1 expression that remains associated 776 
with FA already lowers RhoA activity, while high mCherry-DLC1 expression leads to even 777 
lower RhoA activity and aberrant cell morphology.  778
