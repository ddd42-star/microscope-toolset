SUMMARY
The signaling events controlling proliferation, survival, and apoptosis during mammary epithelial acinar
morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. By imaging single-cell ERK activity dynamics in MCF10A acini,
we ﬁnd that these fates depend on the average frequency of non-periodic ERK pulses. High pulse frequency
is observed during initial acinus growth, correlating with rapid cell motility and proliferation. Subsequent
decrease in motility correlates with lower ERK pulse frequency and quiescence. Later, during lumen forma-
tion, coordinated multicellular ERK waves emerge, correlating with high and low ERK pulse frequencies in
outer surviving and inner dying cells, respectively. Optogenetic entrainment of ERK pulses causally connects
high ERK pulse frequency with inner cell survival. Acini harboring the PIK3CA H1047R mutation display
increased ERK pulse frequency and inner cell survival. Thus, fate decisions during acinar morphogenesis
are coordinated by different spatiotemporal modalities of ERK pulse frequency.
INTRODUCTION
Mammary organogenesis involves formation of a rudimentary
gland during embryogenesis, followed by proliferation and
branching invasion led by multi-layered terminal end buds
(TEBs) during puberty. Cells in the inner TEB layers then undergo
apoptosis to form the ductal lumen. During pregnancy, secretory
alveoli are then formed at the ends of the ductal tree ( Inman et al.,
2015; Paine and Lewis, 2017 ). Morphogenesis of this complex
structure requires spatial and temporal control of cell fates
such as proliferation, survival, migration, and death. However,
the spatiotemporal signaling events that regulate such fate deci-
sions remain poorly explored. The epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor (EGFR)—mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling cascade, which ultimately leads to activation of the
extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), is a key pathway involved
in mammary gland development. EGFR-ERK signaling results
in the upregulation of gene products involved in a wide variety
of processes such as proliferation, survival, migration, and differ-
entiation (Lavoie et al., 2020 ). EGFR activity is required for mam-
mary gland morphogenesis in mice ( Sebastian et al., 1998 ).
Paracrine amphiregulin release by the matrix metallo-protease
(MMP) ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) and its
binding to EGFR mediates the effects of estrogen receptor a to
promote mammary gland development and growth ( Ciarloni
et al., 2007 ; Sternlicht et al., 2005 ). EGFR-dependent ERK activ-
ity is enriched at the front of elongating tubes and coordinates
cell migration ( Huebner et al., 2016 ). In 3D mammary acini, onco-
genic ERK activation suppresses apoptosis and thus lumen for-
mation (Reginato et al., 2005 ). In primary mammary cell culture,
ERK activity is also crucial for survival ( Finlay et al., 2000 ).
Recent single-cell measurements of ERK activity dynamics in
a variety of 2D epithelial monolayer cultures have revealed the
existence of non-periodic ERK pulses of constant amplitude
and duration ( Aikin et al., 2020 ; Albeck et al., 2013 ; Aoki et al.,
2013; Gagliardi et al., 2021 ; Goglia et al., 2020 ; Hino et al.,
2020; Hiratsuka et al., 2015 ). These ERK pulses originate from
MAPK network properties such as ultrasensitivity (leading to
steep ERK activation at a threshold EGFR input) and negative
feedback (leading to ERK adaptation) (Kholodenko et al., 2010 ;
Sparta et al., 2015 ). An emerging theme is that the average fre-
quency of these non-periodic ERK pulses, referred to as ERK fre-
quency from now on, control apoptosis (low frequency), survival
(medium frequency), or proliferation (high frequency) ( Albeck
et al., 2013 ; Aoki et al., 2013 ; Gagliardi et al., 2021 ). These
ERK pulses can either exhibit a stochastic spatially uncorrelated

behavior (Albeck et al., 2013 ; Goglia et al., 2020 ) or can be orga-
nized as wave patterns that regulate collective cell migration in a
wound (Aoki et al., 2017 ; Hino et al., 2020 ; Hiratsuka et al., 2015 ),
cell survival around sites of apoptotic cell extrusion ( Gagliardi
et al., 2021 ; Valon et al., 2021 ), or extrusion of cancer cells ( Aikin
et al., 2020 ). These ERK signaling patterns consist of trigger
waves that involve sequential activation of ERK pulses in adja-
cent epithelial cells through paracrine signaling involving MMP-
mediated cleavage of pro-EGF ligands.
In this work, we explore single-cell ERK dynamics in 3D mam-
mary acini. Culturing mammary MCF10A cells in a basement
membrane matrix (Matrigel) produces acini that retain key fea-
tures of in vivobreast alveoli. Based on previous work ( Anderson
et al., 2010; Debnath et al., 2003), we subdivided this process into
four stages as depicted in Figure S1A. Stage 1 is characterized by
high proliferation rates and basement membrane deposition,
stage 2 consists of a quiescent state and presence of an outer
cell layer with clear basolateral polarity, and stage 3 consists of
apoptosis of inner cells that allows formation of a hollow lumen
in stage 4. The whole process takes approximately 2 weeks.
We document different spatiotemporal modalities of ERK
signaling during different developmental stages of MCF10A acini
formation. Stage 1 is characterized by high ERK frequency,
robust proliferation, and rapid collective motility. This is followed
by a transition to lower ERK frequency and slower collective
motility. During stage 2, formation of ERK wave patterns corre-
lates with domains of different ERK frequencies: outer/inner cells
display medium/low ERK frequencies, respectively, controlling
survival and apoptosis. Optogenetic control of ERK signaling
shows that ERK pulses control collective migration during stage
1 and that a critical ERK frequency is necessary for survival during
stage 2. We characterize a crosstalk between phospho-inositide-
3 kinase (PI3K) and MAPK/ERK signaling that feeds into the regu-
lation of ERK frequency. This provides insight into how oncogenic
PI3K signaling crosstalks with ERK to contribute to loss of lumen
formation. Our work reveals how spatiotemporal control of ERK
frequency organizes mammary acinar morphogenesis.
RESULTS
Stage 1 proliferative acini exhibit non-periodic MMP/
EGFR-dependent ERK pulses whose frequency
correlates with collective cell migration speed
To explore single-cell ERK dynamics during acinar morphogen-
esis, we created MCF10A reporter lines expressing the nuclear
marker histone 2B (H2B) fused to miRFP703 with either the
ERK activity biosensor ERK-KTR fused to mTurquoise2 or a
mCherry-geminin S/G2/M cell cycle marker ( Sakaue-Sawano
et al., 2017 ). ERK-KTR reports on ERK activity through reversible
nucleus/cytosol shuttling after its phosphorylation by active ERK
(Regot et al., 2014 ; Figure 1 A). These lines were then used to
grow acini according to a modiﬁed version of a previously
described protocol ( Debnath et al., 2003 ). After 3 days, in which
EGF, serum, and insulin were required for initial acinar growth,
these GFs were removed to study ERK signaling dynamics
intrinsic to acinar morphogenesis. Using the geminin marker
and a ﬂuorogenic caspase substrate, we evaluated if our proto-
col recapitulated the proliferation, quiescence, and apoptosis
fates previously documented during acinar morphogenesis
(Figures S1 B–S1E; Debnath et al., 2002 ; Liu et al., 2012 ). Stage
1 acini (4 days post-seeding) displayed elevated levels of prolif-
eration and absence of apoptosis. Stages 2 and 3 acini (7 and
11 days post-seeding) revealed quiescent cells and increased
apoptosis leading to lumen formation. Stage 4 acini (14 days
post-seeding) exhibited a mature lumen, abundant apoptotic
debris, and a small increase in proliferation.
We then imaged single-cell ERK dynamics in stage 1 acini us-
ing confocal spinning disk microscopy of both the H2B and ERK-
KTR channels with time resolutions of 3–5 min, until acini started
to suffer from phototoxicity (observed after 10–23 h). Cells in
stage 1 acini displayed asynchronous, non-periodic ERK pulses
(Figure 1 B) as observed in 2D culture ( Aikin et al., 2020 ; Albeck
et al., 2013 ; Gagliardi et al., 2021 ). To extract single-cell ERK ac-
tivity trajectories, we used a customized version of the open-
source LEVERJS software (Wait et al., 2014 ; Winter et al.,
2016) that segments and tracks nuclei based on H2B signal
and calculates ERK activity as a ratio of ERK-KTR ﬂuorescence
intensities in cytosolic and nuclear voxel masks (Figure 1C). De-
trending of the ERK trajectories and normalization of the values
to [0,1] generated a reliable input for automated detection of
ERK pulses ( Figure 1 C). Single-cell ERK trajectories revealed
spontaneous ERK pulses with slightly different amplitudes ( Fig-
ure 1 D). Trametinib-mediated MEK, geﬁtinib-mediated EGFR,
as well as Batimastat-mediated MMP inhibition abolished ERK
pulses (Figure 1 E). MEK or EGFR inhibition for multiple days
led to massive cell death and disintegration of the acini ( Fig-
ure S2 A), suggesting that ERK provides a pro-survival signal.
Acute stimulation with 1 ng/mL EGF induced ERK pulses of am-
plitudes similar to those of spontaneous pulses, whereas 100 ng/
mL EGF induced ERK pulses of higher amplitudes ( Figures 1 F
and 1G). These results document spontaneous, asynchronous
EGFR- and MMP-dependent ERK pulses in stage 1 acini.
As previously described ( Wang et al., 2013 ), stage 1 acini
displayed collective cell motility correlating with a rotational

movement of 360 /C14 of whole acini over multiple hours. Later dur-
ing stage 1, we observed a transition to a state of slower motility
(Figure 2 A; Video S1 ). This was shown to correlate with deposi-
tion of basement membrane around the acinus ( Wang et al.,
2013). The reduction in migration speed correlated with
decreased ERK frequency ( Figures 2 B–2D and S3A; Video S2 ),
without having a signiﬁcant effect on ERK pulse amplitude and
duration ( Figures S3 B and S3C).
Stage 2 quiescent acini exhibit different ERK
frequencies in inner and outer cells, which emerge from
collective waves of ERK pulses
We then evaluated ERK dynamics in larger, stage 2 quiescent acini
that are characterized by an outer layer of polarized cells, and a
less organized inner cell mass destined for apoptosis for future
lumen formation (Debnath et al., 2002 ). When comparing low-
motility stage 1 and stage 2 acini, we observed a further reduction
in median ERK frequency ( Figure 2D), whereas ERK pulse ampli-
tudes and durations remained almost identical ( Figures S3Ba n d
S3C). This change in ERK frequency resulted from a bimodal dis-
tribution in which a part of the cell population did not display any
ERK pulses (Figure 2D). Because ERK pulse frequency can regu-
late proliferation, survival, and apoptosis fates in MCF10A cells (Ai-
kin et al., 2020 ; Albeck et al., 2013 ; Gagliardi et al., 2021 )a n d
because inner cells in stage 2 acini are destined to undergo
apoptosis, we evaluated ERK pulse frequencies in inner versus
outer cells. Outer cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher ERK fre-
quency than inner cells, with the latter often not exhibiting ERK

pulses at all ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Similar
ERK activity amplitude and duration were
found in inner/outer cells (Figures S3Da n d
S3E). Together, with our characterization
of fate decisions ( Figure S1), these results suggest a spatiotem-
poral mechanism that controls survival versus apoptosis fates
through regulation of ERK frequency.
A striking feature of stage 2 acini was that they exhibited
spatially correlated ERK pulses in the form of waves spreading
across multiple cells ( Figures 3B and 3C; Video S3). We devised
computational methods ( Figures S3 F–S3H; STAR Methods )t o
detect, track, and extract features that describe ERK waves.
These ERK waves were observed in all of the stage 2 acini that
we imaged (N = 11) and exhibited different geometries ( Fig-
ure 3D). Although some ERK pulses remained restricted to single
cells, most of the ERK pulses occurred within collective waves
(Figure 3 E). ERK waves typically involved a median of 6 cells
for a median duration of 54 min ( Figures 3 F and 3G). However,
a large variance was observed with some ERK waves involving
as little as 2 and as many as 39 cells (almost the whole acinus).
ERK waves, as well as isolated ERK pulses, were predominantly
initiated in the outer cell layer (Figure 3 H). Furthermore, ERK
waves that originated in the outer layer displayed a higher bias
to remain at that location than those originating in inner cells ( Fig-
ure 3 I). We have previously shown that in 2D MCF10A cultures,
as well as in acini, apoptotic cells trigger ERK waves in their
neighboring cells ( Gagliardi et al., 2021 ). However, the ERK
waves we observed here only rarely coincided with apoptotic
events, suggesting that they originate through a different mech-
anism. Our results strongly suggest that ERK waves contribute
to spatially position different ERK pulse frequencies in inner
and outer acinar cells.

Optogenetic control of ERK frequency regulates
collective motility, survival, and apoptosis fates
To explore the role of ERK pulse frequency during stage 1 collec-
tive motility, as well as stage 2 apoptosis and survival fates
required for lumen morphogenesis, we used two optogenetic ac-
tuators to evoke different ERK pulse frequencies in acini ( Fig-
ure 4 A). Optogenetic ﬁbroblast GF receptor (optoFGFR) is a
cryptochrome 2 (Cry2)-based light-activatable receptor tyrosine
kinase that activates ERK, Akt, and calcium signaling (Kim et al.,
2014). OptoRaf is a N-terminal region of the CRY2-binding
domain of CIB1 (CIBN)/Cry2-based system in which a catalytic
Raf domain is recruited to a plasma membrane targeted anchor
in a light-dependent fashion to speciﬁcally activate ERK ( Aoki
et al., 2017 ). We generated stable lines expressing any of the
two optogenetic constructs, a spectrally compatible ERK-KTR-
mRuby and H2B-miRFP. Application of a single blue light
pulse evoked a discrete optoFGFR- or optoRaf-mediated ERK
pulse with similar shape and duration as spontaneous ones
(Figure 4 B).
Since ERK pulse wave patterns can coordinate collective cell
migration through regulation of myosin activity ( Aoki et al., 2017 ;
Hino et al., 2020 ), we hypothesized that the asynchronous ERK
pulses we observed might coordinate the collective motility
pattern in stage 1 acini. We therefore sought to disrupt this pro-
cess by synchronizing ERK pulses across all the cells of an
acinus. We imaged rotating stage 1 acini for 4 h in the absence
of blue light and observed asynchronous ERK pulses ( Figure 4C).
We then applied high frequency light pulses at 30-min intervals,
which synchronized ERK pulses across cells ( Figure 4 C; Video
S4). This switch to synchronous high frequency ERK pulsing in
all cells immediately resulted in decreased cell migration speed
and persistence (Figures 4 D–4F). This suggests that the asyn-
chronous high frequency ERK pulses organize collective cell
migration in stage 1 acini.
Next, we tested the hypothesis that the different ERK fre-
quencies observed between outer and inner cells in stage 2 acini
regulate survival versus apoptosis cell fates. Using optoFGFR
and optoRaf, we evoked frequency-modulated, population-syn-
chronous ERK dynamics in all the cells of an acinus ( Figure 5 A;
Video S5). Endogenous collective ERK pulses were however still
occurring. Because the regulation of apoptosis/survival fates
required for lumen formation spans over 1 week, we could not
use our live-cell imaging platform to study this process. We
therefore used LED illumination tool for optogenetic stimulation
(LITOS) (Ho¨ hener et al., 2022 ) to evoke frequency-modulated
ERK pulse regimes in multiwell plates in a tissue culture incu-
bator ( Figure S4 A). This system evoked similar ERK pulses as
observed in our live-cell imaging system ( Figure S4 B). We then
stimulated stage 2 acini with light pulses delivered at different
frequencies for 7 days and scored the distribution of acini that
exhibited ﬁlled lumen, partially cleared lumen, or cleared lumen
(Figure 5 B). Using both optoFGFR and optoRaf, we observed
that ERK pulses induced every 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, but not 10 h led
to survival of inner cells, increasing the number of acini with ﬁlled
or partially cleared lumina ( Figure 5C). These results further sug-
gest that survival and apoptosis fates are regulated by a fre-
quency encoded ERK signal. The optoRaf experiments indicate
that high frequency ERK pulsing alone is sufﬁcient to induce sur-
vival independently of PI3K/Akt signaling.
Because endogenous ERK pulses occur on top of optogeneti-
cally induced ones, we used optoFGFR to evoke different ERK
pulse frequencies in EGFR-inhibited acini that do not exhibit
spontaneous ERK pulses. Here, unstimulated acini and those
stimulated every 10 h displayed cell death. In marked contrast,
ERK pulses applied at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h led to cell survival (Fig-
ure 5D). These results show that cells in acini must experience at
least one ERK pulse every 4 h to survive.
ERK frequency, but not, integrated ERK activity
regulates the survival fate
Next, we explored if the frequency of ERK pulses or the total in-
tegrated ERK activity over time controls survival. To test this, we
used optoFGFR to induce synthetic ERK pulses of different
widths, which when applied at different frequencies can evoke
the same integrated ERK activity over a speciﬁc time period.
Since ERK pulses display an identical shape and promote sur-
vival for 4 h both in serum-deprived 2D monolayers ( Gagliardi
et al., 2021 ) and 3D acini, we ﬁrst identiﬁed light stimulation
schemes capable of inducing ERK pulses of different widths in
monolayers. We applied a series of 1–86 successive blue light
pulses delivered at 2-min intervals and recorded the resulting
ERK dynamics ( Figure S4C). We have previously shown that light
stimulation applied at this frequency leads to sustained op-
toFGFR activity (Dessauges et al., 2022 ). The integrated ERK ac-
tivity (area under the curve [AUC]) displayed a linear relationship
with the number of light pulses ( Figure S4D). 20 blue light pulses
delivered every 2 min led to a single ERK pulse with a 3-fold in-
crease in integrated ERK activity. We then applied 2 distinct op-
toFGFR stimulation schemes consisting of 1 AUC equivalent of
ERK activity evoked every 3 h versus 3 AUC equivalents
of ERK activity evoked every 9 h, resulting in the identical inte-
grated ERK activity over a period of 9 h ( Figure 5 E). We found
that the ﬁrst but not second optogenetic stimulation scheme
induced cell survival in serum-deprived 2D cultures (Figure 5 F).
We then performed the identical experiment in stage 2 acini by
applying the two optogenetic stimulation schemes using LITOS
for 7 days. Quantiﬁcation of lumen formation efﬁciency at day
14 revealed increased inner cell survival when the ﬁrst, but not
the second, optogenetic stimulation scheme was applied ( Fig-
ure 5 G). These results show that the frequency of ERK pulses
rather than the integrated ERK activity regulates survival.
Inner and outer acinar cells do not have different ERK
receptor threshold inputs or refractory periods
We then also used our optogenetic toolkit to explore a number of
scenarios of how different ERK frequencies in inner/outer cells

might be regulated in stage 2 acini. We ﬁrst explored if the MAPK
network reacts differently to extracellular inputs in outer and in-
ner cells in stage 2 acini. The MAPK pathway is wired to produce
ultrasensitive, all-or-nothing ERK pulses at threshold GF inputs
(Huang and Ferrell, 1996 ). In between the input range that
does not activate ERK, and the one that produces robust full
amplitude ERK pulses, a small input range often leads to non-
robust, heterogeneous ERK responses (Ryu et al., 2015 ). We
therefore reasoned that differential ERK pulse frequency
observed in outer/inner cells might result from the ability of the
MAPK network to shift its sensitivity to inputs depending on its
location within an acinus. We therefore identiﬁed optoFGFR light
inputs of different strengths that either do not activate ERK, that
lead to ERK pulses with heterogeneous amplitudes, or that lead
to full amplitude ERK pulses ( Figure S5A). We observed that the
different light-induced optoFGFR inputs of different strengths,
which are perceived equally across all the cells of the acinus,
led to identical ERK responses irrespective of the location of sin-
gle cells within stage 2 acini. This suggests that the ERK pulse
frequency does not depend on spatial regulation of the MAPK
network’s ability to produce switch-like, all-or-nothing ERK
responses.
Second, we reasoned that a ﬁrst receptor input might desen-
sitize the MAPK network to a second input differently in inner and
outer cells in stage 2 acini, as a possible mechanism of spatio-
temporal control of ERK pulse frequency. This could for example
be regulated by ERK-dependent transcriptional activation of
dual speciﬁcity phosphatases (DUSPs) that switch off ERK

signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated stage 2 acini
with successive optoFGFR inputs delivered at 15- and 21-min in-
tervals. These correspond to speciﬁc times at which an ERK
pulse has not yet adapted to baseline (15-min interval), and at
which, an ERK pulse has adapted to the baseline. We observed
that these speciﬁc temporal stimulation schemes did not yield
different ERK dynamics in inner and outer cells in stage 2 acini
(Figure S5 B). This strongly suggests the absence of spatiotem-
poral control of ERK-dependent desensitization of ERK pulses
in stage 2 acini. The most likely scenario that explains the
different ERK pulse frequencies in inner versus outer cells in
stage 2 acini is therefore the formation of ERK waves.
Oncogenic PI3K signaling increases ERK frequency
leading to loss of acinar lumen formation
We then explored ERK dynamics in the context of a pathological
alteration of acinar morphogenesis induced by the H1047R mu-
tation in the alpha subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA), which is frequently
mutated in breast cancer ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 ).
The H1047R PIK3CA mutation leads to absence of lumen in
MCF10A knockin acini (Berglund et al., 2013 ; Chakrabarty
et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 2013 ; Isakoff et al., 2005 ; Lauring
et al., 2010 ), as well as ductal hyperplasia in a transgenic mouse
model ( Tikoo et al., 2012 ). H1047R PIK3CA MCF10A knockin
cells have been shown to display elevated ERK activity using
western blot ( Gustin et al., 2009 ), strongly suggesting the exis-
tence of a crosstalk between oncogenic PI3K and MAPK/ERK
signaling. Consistently, we found that H1047R PIK3CA
MCF10A knockin cells cultured as monolayers displayed higher
median ERK frequency than their wild-type (WT) counterparts
(Figures 6 A–6C) while maintaining similar ERK pulse shape,
duration, and amplitude ( Figures 6D, S6A, and S6B). The ﬁnding
of a similar ERK pulse shape in WT and mutant cells indicates
that the PI3K to MAPK crosstalk must occur upstream of ras
because the MAPK network structure that shapes ERK dy-
namics is maintained ( Kholodenko et al., 2010 ). The increased
ERK frequency suggests the involvement of receptor level inter-
actions (Sparta et al., 2015 ).
To better understand the effect of the PIK3CA H1047R on
acinar morphogenesis, we evaluated proliferation and apoptosis
during different stages (Figures 6E–6I). Stage 1 mutant acini dis-
played increased proliferation compared with their WT counter-
parts, as evidenced by augmented cell numbers, and geminin
quantiﬁcation (Figures 6E–6G). Although remaining slightly higher
than in WT acini, proliferation also diminished during stages 2–4
but displayed a small upshoot during stage 4 ( Figures 6 Ea n d
6G). In contrast to the steep apoptosis rise observed starting on
day 7 in WT acini, apoptotic rates remained lower in PIK3CA
mutant acini at all stages ( Figures 6E and 6H). Increased prolifer-
ation at stage 1 and decreased apoptosis at stages 3 and 4, thus
mostly contribute to increased cell number and absence of lumen
formation in PIK3CA-mutant acini ( Figure 6I).
We then evaluated ERK dynamics during the pathological acinar
morphogenesis induced by PIK3CA H1047R. As in monolayers,
PIK3CA-mutant acini displayed ERK pulses like those of WT acini
(Figure 7A). Stage 1 rotating PIK3CA-mutant acini displayed ERK
frequencies as high as those observed in their WT counterparts
(Figure 7B). However, stage 1 non-rotating PIK3CA-mutant acini
did not display the decreased ERK frequency observed in WT (Fig-
ure 7 B). Stage 2 PIK3CA-mutant acini displayed increased ERK
frequency compared with WT, as well as prominent ERK waves
(Figures 7B–7D; Video S6). However, most likely due to their het-
erogeneity, we could not pinpoint a speciﬁc feature of ERK waves
associated with the increased ERK frequency observed in
PIK3CA-mutant versus WT acini. PIK3CA-mutant stage 2 dis-
played higher ERK frequencies than WT acini, leading the inner
cells of PIK3CA-mutant to exhibit a similar ERK frequency than
the outer cells of WT acini ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Amplitude and
duration of ERK pulses were similar for both WT and PIK3CA
H1047R acinar cells at all stages ( Figures S6C and S6D).
Pictilisib-mediated PI3K or AZD5363-mediated Akt inhibition
decreased ERK frequency in both WT and mutant acini (Figure 7E).
Stimulation of WT acini with insulin-like GF 1 (IGF1), which primar-
ily activates PI3K-Akt signaling (Myers et al., 1993), also resulted in
increased ERK pulse frequency ( Figures S7A and S7B). Geﬁtinib-
mediated EGFR inhibition abolished ERK pulses in PIK3CA-
mutant acini, suggesting an EGFR-dependent mechanism ( Fig-
ure S7 C). Batimastat-mediated MMP inhibition in PIK3CA
H1047R cells led to reduction of ERK phosphorylation to levels
observed in WT cells, without affecting Akt signaling ( Figure S7D).
PIK3CA H1047R MCF10A cells have been shown to exhibit
increased expression of the EGFR-ligand amphiregulin in com-
parison to WT cells (Young et al., 2015), possibly explaining the in-
crease in EGFR-dependent ERK frequency. Consistently, we
observed increased amphiregulin expression at mRNA level in
PI3K-mutant when compared with WT cells. Amphiregulin expres-
sion levels were decreased upon pictilisib-mediated inhibition of
PI3K activity in PIK3CA mutant cells ( Figure S7E). Together, these
results strongly suggest that the PI3K to MAPK/ERK crosstalk that
regulates ERK frequency involves amphiregulin/MMP-activation
of EGFR. Increased survival in PIK3CA H1047R acini might there-
fore involve increased ERK frequency through this crosstalk
mechanism, in addition to PI3K-Akt signaling.
DISCUSSION
Recent work in epithelial monolayers has revealed the existence of
non-periodic single-cell ERK pulses, whose frequency controls
apoptosis, survival, or proliferation fates (Albeck et al., 2013 ;
Aoki et al., 2013 ; Gagliardi et al., 2021 ; Valon et al., 2021 ). At the
level of a cell population, these ERK pulses can be stochastic
when cells are stimulated with EGF (Albeck et al., 2013 )o rc a n
be organized as collective ERK waves during collective cell migra-
tion (Aoki et al., 2017; Hino et al., 2020), cancer cell extrusion (Aikin
et al., 2020 ), or spatial regulation of survival in response to stress
(Gagliardi et al., 2021; Valon etal., 2021). Here, we show that similar
ERK pulses/waves coordinate fate decisions during mammary
acinar morphogenesis. As in the cell systems mentioned above,

ERK pulses are triggered by MMP-mediated cleavage of pro-EGF
ligands and subsequent activation of EGFR. Downstream of
EGFR, MAPK network properties such as ultrasensitivity and
negative feedback ( Huang and Ferrell, 1996 ; Kholodenko et al.,
2010) might allow to translate minute amounts of MMP-cleaved
pro-EGF into clear cut digital ERK pulses. Consistently, the slightly
lower amplitude of spontaneous ERK pulses versus those induced
by acute EGF stimulation suggests that the EGFR/MAPK system
functions at the threshold input to generate digital ERK pulses (Fig-
ure 1G). This might allow the MMP/EGFR/MAPK signaling network
to translate small variations in the EGFR input into frequency-
modulated regimes of ERK pulses that can specify proliferation,
survival, and apoptosis. Note that exogenous addition of EGF im-
pedes apoptosis-mediated lumen formation ( Gaiko-Shcherbak
et al., 2015 ), further suggesting that small amounts of EGFR li-
gands synthesized by the acinus itself are necessary for self-orga-
nization of signaling for its morphogenesis. This MMP/EGFR/
MAPK network has also been shown to produce ERK trigger
waves in which activated cells sequentially switch on ERK pulses
in adjacent cells ( Aoki et al., 2017 ; Boocock et al., 2021 ; Hino
et al., 2020 ). Our results strongly suggest that the ERK waves
observed in stage 2 acini rely on this mechanism. Thus, a relatively
simple signaling network might allow to produce conserved and
sophisticated ERK behaviors in epithelial collectives. This excit-
able MMP/EGFR/MAPK network that generates pulsatile ERK ac-
tivity strongly contrasts with the oscillatory ERK behavior observed
in the segmentation clock in vertebrate embryos that is regulated
on slower timescales by rhythmic transcriptional regulation of
MAPK phosphatases (Hubaud and Pourquie´ ,2 0 1 4). We speculate
that the pulsatile MAPK network observed in epithelia provides an
opportunity to constantly sense and react to environmental inputs
such as GFs and insults to warrant epithelial homeostasis during
acinar development. This illustrates how the MAPK network can
be differently wired to produce distinct ERK dynamics at different
timescales depending on the developmental context.
ERK dynamics regulate collective migration and
proliferation in stage 1 acini
We found that stage 1 acini displayed high frequency, asynchro-
nous ERK pulses during rapid collective cell migration that leads
to a global rotation behavior of the acinus ( Figure 2). This rotation
behavior has previously been implicated in the morphogenesis of
spherical tissue buds during mammary organogenesis (Ferna´ n-
dez et al., 2021 ). During migration of 2D epithelial sheets, ERK
waves coordinate myosin activity necessary for collective motility
and are shaped by a mechanochemical feedback from myosin to
ERK ( Aoki et al., 2017 ; Boocock et al., 2021 ; Hino et al., 2020 ).
Furthermore, ERK also has been shown to control myosin activity
in MCF10A acini single-cell motility (Pearson and Hunter, 2007 ).
We therefore propose that asynchronous ERK pulses spatially co-
ordinate myosin contractility necessary for this collective motility
behavior. This is consistent with our result that optogenetic syn-
chronization of ERK pulses immediately leads to decreased col-
lective motility (Figures 4C–4F). The transition to a state of slower
motility in late stage 1 acini has been shown to result from assem-
bly of an endogenous laminin-rich basement membrane ( Wang
et al., 2013 ). We speculate that assembly of this basement mem-
brane might modify the myosin-ERK mechanochemical feedback
loop mentioned above, leading to decreased ERK frequency and
motility, allowing to regulate the transition from proliferation to
quiescence. Assembly of the basement membrane might there-
fore act as a checkpoint coordinating ERK frequency-dependent
regulation of motility and transition from proliferation to quies-
cence. Future experimental/modeling studies will be necessary
to further reﬁne this hypothesis.
ERK waves spatially regulate apoptosis and survival
fates during stage 2 acinar lumen morphogenesis
Our experiments in stage 2 acini suggest that spatial control of
different ERK frequencies regulates survival in outer versus
apoptosis fates in inner acinar cells. Outer cells display a median
ERK frequency of one pulse every 4 h, whereas inner cells display
lower ERK frequencies (Figure 3A). This is consistent with the abil-
ity of one ERK pulse to provide about 4 h of survival in MCF10A
monolayers (Gagliardi et al., 2021 ). Using optogenetic control of
ERK pulses, we excluded mechanisms such as differential GF re-
ceptor sensitivity or refractory time of inner and outer cells for
regulation of different ERK frequencies ( Figures S5 A and S5B).
Instead, our results suggest a role for collective ERK waves to
deﬁne the outer and inner spatial domains of high and low ERK fre-
quency, which, respectively, specify survival and apoptosis fates
(Figures 3B–3I). ERK wave properties such as that they are initi-
ated mostly in the outer layer and propagate more efﬁciently in
the outer versus the inner layer might dynamically specify the
two domains of ERK frequencies on timescale of hours throughout
the 7 days of the acinus cavitation process. Although apoptosis is
predominantly responsible for the clearance of luminal cells in
acini (Debnath et al., 2002 ), we cannot exclude that an alternative
mechanism such as autophagy resulting from metabolic defects
in inner cells, which is regulated by EGFR-PI3K signaling might
also contribute to this process ( Schafer et al., 2009 ).
ERK pulse frequency, but not, integrated activity
regulates survival versus apoptosis fates
To formally test if ERK frequency regulates survival/apoptosis
fates, we used optogenetic stimulation of all the cells of acini
to causally link ERK frequency with lumen formation. When
used to evoke ERK pulses for up to at least every 4 h, both op-
toFGFR and optoRaf led to loss of lumen formation ( Figure 5 C).
ERK pulses evoked every 10 h were not sufﬁcient to rescue
apoptosis. These experiments also functioned when EGFR
was completely inhibited ( Figure 5D). By optogenetically varying
the ERK pulse width, we also showed that ERK frequency rather
than the integrated ERK activity over time regulates survival
borders (red lines), luminal space (dashed red lines), and the border between the cleared and ﬁlled part of the luminal space (dashed green lines) are i ndicated.

versus apoptosis fates, both in monolayers and in stage 2 acinus
lumen formation ( Figures 5 E–5G). Our data therefore suggest
that short ERK pulses are the signaling unit that allows cells in
acini to commit to survival for about 4 h. This might allow cells
to integrate signaling inputs that ﬂuctuate on timescales of mi-
nutes/hours to dynamically control a morphogenetic program
on timescales of days. Interpretation of a speciﬁc ERK frequency
into survival/apoptosis fates might involve the ERK substrate
Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Harada et al., 2004 ) or ERK-dependent
transcriptional control of immediate early genes (IEGs) ( Avraham
and Yarden, 2011 ). IEGs produce transcripts with lifetimes of
around 30 min, which encode proteins with lifetimes of 1–3 h.
Notably, IEGs include Jun and Fos transcription factors that
are important regulators of cell survival ( Shaulian and Karin,
2001). IEG’s short lifetime is compatible with the ERK frequency
required for survival. Higher ERK frequencies as observed in
stage 1 acini might control proliferation by regulation of IEGs
such as Fra-1 (Gillies et al., 2017 ).
Oncogenic PI3K signaling modulates ERK frequency
contributing to aberrant acinar morphogenesis
Our results show that the breast cancer relevant PIK3CA
H1047R mutation increases ERK frequency, which might
contribute at least in part to increased proliferation and survival
leading to larger acini without lumen formation, that phenocopies
ductal hyperplasia observed in mouse models ( Tikoo et al.,
2012). We show that this crosstalk from PI3K to ERK signaling
feeds into the control of ERK frequency both in WT and
PIK3CA H1047R monolayers and acini ( Figures 7 , S6, and S7).
This crosstalk also functions downstream of IGF1, which

primarily activates PI3K-Akt signaling ( Myers et al., 1993 ;
Figures S7 A and S7B), suggesting that it is a conserved feature
downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. During stage
1, PIK3CA H1047R acini display similarly high ERK frequencies
as in WT acini (Figure 7B). During stage 2, PIK3CA H1047R acini
then still display a substantial decrease in ERK frequency as in
WT acini compared with stage 1 ( Figure 7 B), which correlates
with decreased proliferation ( Figures 6E–6H). However, ERK fre-
quencies remain slightly higher both in outer and inner cells in
PIK3CA H1047R versus WT acini, correlating with the strong sur-
vival phenotype in inner cells and absence of lumen formation.
These results suggest that the control of ERK frequency is still
subject to some degree of regulation even when the crosstalk
from PIK3CA H1047R is constitutively switched on. Because
the ERK pulse shape is identical in WT and PIK3CA mutant cells,
this crosstalk must occur upstream of the core Raf/MEK/ERK
circuit. Consistently, ERK activation is sensitive to both EGFR
and MMP inhibition in PIK3CA H1047R cells (Figures S7 C and
S7D). As reported previously ( Young et al., 2015 ), our data
strongly suggest that constitutive PI3K activity in PIK3CA
H1047R cells leads to increased expression of the EGFR-ligand
amphiregulin that in turn might increase ERK frequency (Stern-
licht et al., 2005 ; Figure S7 E). PIK3CA H1047R also has been
found to decrease expression of the protein tyrosine phospha-
tase receptor type F (PTPRF) (Young et al., 2015 ), which might
further augment EGFR excitability and thus ERK frequency.
Further work is required to elucidate the speciﬁc contributions
of PI3K and ERK signaling to control the survival/apoptosis
fate decisions and how the PI3K/ERK crosstalk might spatially
ﬁne tune ERK frequency. Our result strongly suggests that onco-
genic PI3K signaling-induced aberrant spatial regulation of ERK
frequency contributes to pathological acinar morphogenesis.
Limitations of the study
We provide an initial characterization into how single-cell ERK
dynamics control fate decisions in space and time during the
morphogenesis of a simple prototype organ structure. Future
studies are required to mechanistically understand how the
different dynamic signaling states are encoded and spatially
organized, and if they provide robustness against environmental
perturbations occurring during development. This will require the
ever-expanding arsenal of optogenetic tools to manipulate spe-
ciﬁc cells and evaluate how the cell collective responds. Further
questions include how additional signaling pathways might ﬁne
tune this morphogenetic process, and how the ERK frequency
is decoded into transcriptional programs that actuate the
different fates that shape acinus morphogenesis. Finally, intra-
vital imaging of ERK dynamics in mice will reveal if similar
signaling patterns are relevant in vivo, and how they might be
modulated by a more complex stromal environment.

200 U/ml penicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin. Horse serum, insulin and EGF were removed after 3 days of culture. For live imaging,
25 mM Hepes was added to the medium prior to mounting on the microscope.
CellEvent Caspase 3/7 Green Detection Reagent used for the detection of apoptosis was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
and used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Plasmids
ERK-KTR-mTurquoise2 and ERK-KTR-mRuby2 were generated by fusion of the coding region of ERK-KTR ( Regot et al., 2014 ) with
that of mTurquoise2 ( Goedhart et al., 2012 ) or mRuby2 ( Lam et al., 2012 ). H2B-miRFP703 was generated by fusion of the coding
region of human H2B clustered histone 11 (H2BC11) with that of miRFP703 ( Shcherbakova et al., 2016 ). Geminin-mCherry was
generated by fusion of the ubiquitylation domain of human Geminin ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 ) to mCherry. The above mentioned
fusion proteins were cloned in the piggyBac vectors pMP-PB, pSB-HPB ( Balasubramanian et al., 2016 ) (gift of David Hacker, EPFL,
Switzerland), or pPB3.0.Blast, an improved version of pPB generated in our lab (see key resources table ).
pPB3.0-PuroCRY2-cRAF-mCitrine-P2A-CIBN-KrasCT, referred to in the manuscript as OptoRAF, was generated in the following
way: The CRY2-cRaf sequence was excised from pCX4puro-CRY2-cRAF (gift from Kazuhiro Aoki, National Institute for Basic
Biology, Japan (Aoki et al., 2017 )) using EcoRI and NotI. mCitrine was PCR ampliﬁed from the optoFGFR plasmid, while adding
NotI and XhoI sites, and digested. Both sequences were ligated into pPB3.0-Puro, previously digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The
GSGP2A-CIBN-KRasCT sequence (synthesized by GENEWIZ) was digested with BsrGI and AﬂII and ligated into pPB3.0-Puro-
CRY2-cRAF-mCitrine.
The piggyBac plasmids were co-transfected with a helper plasmid expressing a hyperactive piggyBac transposase ( Yusa
et al., 2011 ).
Lyn-cytoFGFR1-PHR-mCit, expressing myristoylated FGFR1 cytoplasmic region fused with the PHR domain of cryptochrome2
and mCitrine (gift from Won Do Heo, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Republic of Korea, (Addgene plasmid # 59776), ( Kim et al.,
2014)), referred to in the manuscript as OptoFGFR, was subcloned in a lentiviral backbone for stable cell line generation.
Imaging
All acini images were acquired on an epiﬂuorescence Eclipse Ti2 inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-W1
spinning disk confocal system (Yokogawa) and a Plan Apo VC 60X water immersion objective (NA = 1.2). For time lapse imaging,
laser-based autofocus was used. Images were acquired with a Prime 95B or a Prime BSI sCMOS camera (both Teledyne Photomet-
rics) at 16-bit depth. Temperature, CO2 and humidity were controlled throughout live imaging with a temperature control system and
gas mixer (both Life Imaging Services). The following lasers were used for excitation: far red/miRFP: 638 nm, red/mRuby/mCherry:
561 nm, green/yellow: 515 nm, cyan/mTurquoise: 445 nm. The following emission ﬁlters were used: CFP/YFP/mCherry - Triple and
DAPI/FITC/TRITC/Cy5 multiband quad.
All monolayer cell images were acquired on an epiﬂuorescence Eclipse Ti inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon) with a Plan
Apo 20x air objective (NA = 0.8) or a Plan Apo 40X air objective (NA = 0.9). Laser-based autofocus was used throughout imaging.
Images were acquired with an Andor Zyla 4.2 plus camera at 16-bit depth. The following excitation and emission ﬁlters (Chroma)
were used: far red: 640nm, ET705/72m; red: 555nm, ET652/60m; green: 470nm, ET525/36m; mTurquoise2: 440nm, HQ480/40.
Both microscopes were controlled by NIS elements (Nikon).
Inhibitors and growth factors
Geﬁtinib was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck and used at a concentration of 10 mM. Trametinib was obtained from Selleck
Chemicals and used at a concentration of 5 mM. Batimastat was obtained from MedChem Express and used at a concentration
of 30 mM. Pictilisib was obtained from Selleck Chemicals and used at a concentration of 250 nM. AZD5363 was obtained from Selleck
Chemicals and used at a concentration of 5 mM. IGF1 was obtained from Peprotech and used at a concentration of 100 nM.
Optogenetic experiments
For short term optogenetics experiments performed directly on the microscope, acini were illuminated with wide ﬁeld blue light
(470 nm LED) at deﬁned time points during spinning disc time lapse imaging. Acini expressing optoFGF were illuminated for
100 ms at 50% LED intensity. Acini expressing optoRAF were illuminated for 100 ms at 60% LED intensity. The NIS elements
JOBS module was used to program the imaging and stimulation patterns.
The 2D monolayer optogenetic experiments were executed by culturing MCF10A expressing optoFGFR, ERK-KTR-mRuby2 and
H2B-miRFP703 as conﬂuent monolayer on 24 well plates with glass bottom. Optogenetic stimulation was done with 488 nm LED light
at 100% light intensity for 100ms and using a 20x air objective. To generate larger ERK activity pulses, cells were stimulated with
trains of 488 nm light pulses with a 2 min interval. The area under the curve (AUC) of ERK activity was calculated using the ERK activity
levels before and after the ERK pulses to set the baseline. The correlation function between the number of 488 nm light pulses and
AUC was obtained by linear regression. The effects of different frequencies with same AUC on apoptosis was measured after 24
hours of time-lapse acquisition and manual annotation of apoptotic events on the base of morphological alterations of cell nucleus.
For long term optogenetic stimulation with the LITOS system, glass bottom 96-well cell culture plates with 7-day old acini were
ﬁtted on a 32 x 64 RGB LED matrix (Boxtec) inside a cell culture incubator. The matrix was connected to a custom printed circuit
board with an ESP32 microcontroller. This system was programmed to emit 1-minute blue light pulses at maximal intensity at deﬁned

intervals for 7 days, after which lumen formation efﬁciency was assessed. Acini were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde prior to
imaging.
Image analysis of 3D acini
The open source LEVERJS software ( Cohen, 2014 ; Wait et al., 2014 ; Winter et al., 2016 ) was used to analyze the 3D time lapse
movies. The LEVERJS software was updated to include improved processing and visualization capabilities. The processing pipeline
began with a GPU-accelerated 3D non-local means denoising algorithm ( Wait et al., 2019 ). After denoising, a new ensemble-based
segmentation algorithm was applied. This ensemble segmentation combined an adaptive thresholding into foreground/background
regions with an anisotropic 3D Laplacian of Gaussian ﬁlter targeted to a speciﬁc cell radius to separate touching cells (Winter et al.,
2019). The base segmentation was run at different cell radii and the results were combined using unsupervised learning techniques
from the ﬁeld of algorithmic information theory ( Cohen et al., 2009 ). Here, the radii evaluated ranged from 2.5 mmt o4 mm in 0.5 mm
steps. These values were set empirically based on expected cell size ranges. Following segmentation, the cells were tracked using
Multitemporal Association Tracking ( Winter et al., 2011 ; Winter et al., 2012 ).
Following segmentation and tracking of the image sequences, the ERK-KTR signal was extracted and processed to a detrended
and normalized signal. To extract the ERK-KTR signal, distance transforms were computed for each segmented image. The interior
distance transform assigned each cell interior voxel a numeric value indicating its distance starting at the cell boundary and
increasing to the centroid. The exterior distance transform assigned each boundary voxel a numeric value indicating its distance
to the nearest cell-assigned voxel. The exterior distance transform also provided the identity of the nearest cell-assigned voxel for
each background voxel. The ERK-KTR signal was computed as the ratio of the image values around the center of the cell to the image
values around the boundary of the cell. The center region of the cell included voxels in the 95 th percentile of the interior distance trans-
form. For the boundary region of the cell, we included interior voxels within one unit of the boundary and exterior voxels within three
units of the boundary. The resulting ERK-KTR signal was computed as the ratio of the median voxel value in the outer region to the
median voxel value in the inner region. The extracted ERK-KTR signals for each cell had different base intensities and showed
different amounts of ﬂuctuation. To normalize this and to allow for quantitative comparison and visual representation with different
cell ERK-KTR expression levels we computed a detrended and normalized ERK-KTR signal as follows. The signal S was ﬁrst de-
trended by subtracting the median ﬁlter signal, Sd = S /C0 median filterðSÞ. The signal was then normalized to the range [0,1] using
Snd = Sd=maxðSdÞ, unless the signal range in the detrended trajectory was below an empirically set threshold.
For segmentation and quantiﬁcation of steady state Z-stacks, CellProﬁler 3.1.8 ( McQuin et al., 2018 ) with 3D functionalities was
used. Nuclei were identiﬁed based on H2B-miRFP signals. Apoptotic debris were identiﬁed using Caspase 3/7 Green Detection
kit signals using adaptive thresholding and watershed segmentation. Geminin-mCherry intensities were measured within nuclei voxel
masks. ERK-KTR cytosolic/nuclear intensity ratios were generated by measuring median ERK-KTR intensities in the nuclear area and
in a spherical voxel mask 1 pixel around the nuclear objects. Imaris software (Bitplane) was used for 3D rendering of confocal stacks
and to track and measure motility parameters in Figures 2 and 4. ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 ) was used to assemble micrographs
in Figures 1 , 4, 7, S1, and S2.
Image analysis of 2D cell cultures
Nuclei of monolayer cells were segmented using Ilastik ( Berg et al., 2019 ) and CellProﬁler 3.0. Ilastik was used for training a random
forest classiﬁer on different pixel features of the H2B-miRFP channel and background pixels. The training data was generated by
manual annotation of 20 - 50 cells. The resulting probability map was imported into CellProﬁler for thresholding and segmentation.
Cytosolic ERK-KTR ﬂuorescence intensities were measured by expansion of the nuclear objects. Cells were tracked using m-track
2.2.1 ( Jaqaman et al., 2008 ).
Data analysis
For visualization and analysis of ERK activity trajectories Time Course Inspector ( Dobrzy/C19nski et al., 2020 ), as well as custom R ( R Core
Team, 2017 )/Matlab/Python code (publicly available at Mendeley Data ( https://doi.org/10.17632/ywjgj97g74.1)) was used.
ERK activity pulse detection
ERK activity peaks were identiﬁed and counted by the following steps. 1. Application of a short median ﬁlter to smooth the time series.
2. Application of a long median ﬁlter to produce a bias estimate which was subtracted from the smoothed time series. 3. Detrended
time-series with real peaks were then identiﬁed by selecting those with an activity difference above an empirical threshold. Those
were rescaled to [0,1] and a local maxima detection algorithm was used to identify peaks above an amplitude of 0.1. Inner and outer
cells in stage 2 acini were identiﬁed visually based on the 3D reconstructions in LEVERJS.
Identiﬁcation of collective events
To identify waves of collective ERK activation we developed a custom code and implemented it in R. The algorithm works on a bi-
narised signal that is calculated by detrending and normalising ERK-KTR cytosolic/nuclear intensity ratio time series as described
above (Figures S3F and S3G). The algorithm searches for the ﬁrst occurrence of cells with ERK switched on ( Figure S3H). If several
such cells exist and they are located within a threshold radius, they initiate the ﬁrst collective event. A single active cell can also
become a collective event. In the next time point, the algorithm repeats the search for active cells and compares their distances
ll

to cells in the previous frame. If new active cells are located within the threshold distance to active cells at the previous time point,
they are added to respective collective events. If new active cells are located outside of the threshold distance, they form new col-
lective events. This process of growing clusters of collective activity is repeated for all remaining time points. The resulting statistics
include the total number of cells involved in a collective event, the duration and the average size of an event and the location (inner or
outer layer) of the cells that initiates the event.
Immunoblotting and qPCR
Cells were plated into 6-well dishes (2 x 10 5 cells/well) and cultured for 48h. The resulting cell monolayers were washed twice with
room temperature PBS, then starving medium was added. For immunoblotting 1uL/mL DMSO or 10ug/mL Batimastat was added
together with the starving medium and cells were further cultured for 72h. Media was removed, monolayers were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS, whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described before ( Dessauges et al.,
2022). Primary antibodies against the following proteins/epitopes were used: phospho-AKT Ser473 (cat. # 4058), AKT (cat. # 9272),
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) Thr202/Tyr204 (cat. # 4370), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (cat. # 4695), all from Cell Signaling Technologies,
BioConcept Ltd. Secondary IRDye680LT- or IRDye800CW-conjugated anti-species speciﬁc IgGs were from LI-COR. For qPCR cells
were ﬁrst starved for 24h, then fresh starving medium containing 1uL/mL DMSO or 2uM and 10uM pictilisib was added and cells were
cultured for 24h. Media was removed, monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent.
Reverse transcription was done with the ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Bioconcept, M0368L). Real-time qPCR reactions
were run using the MESA Green qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Green assay (Eurogenetec, RT-SY2X-03+WOU) on the Rotor-
Gen Q device (Qiagen). Each sample was tested in triplicate. Expression of the gene of interest was calculated using the 2-DDCt
method. The sequences of the primer sets used are as follows: AREG, 5’ -ACA TTT CCA TTC TCT TGT CG- 3’ (forward), and 5’ -
ACA TTT CCA TTC TCT TGT CG- 3’ (reverse); FLJ22101, 5’ -TTC CCT GTG GCA CTT GAC ATT- 3’ (forward), and 5’-CTT TTG
