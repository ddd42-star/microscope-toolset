Abstract
Rho GTPases are versatile regulators of cell shape that act on the actin cytoskeleton. Studies using
Rho GTPase mutants have shown that, in some cells, Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate the formation of
lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively at the leading edge, whereas RhoA mediates contraction at
the rear of moving cells. However, recent reports have described a zone of RhoA/ROCK activation
at the front of cells undergoing motility. In this study, we use a FRET-based RhoA biosensor to show
that RhoA activation localizes to the leading edge of EGF-stimulated cells. Inhibition of Rho or
ROCK enhanced protrusion, yet markedly inhibited cell motility; these changes correlated with a
marked activation of Rac-1 at the cell edge. Surprisingly, whereas EGF-stimulated protrusion in
control MTLn3 cells is Rac-independent and Cdc42-dependent, the opposite pattern is observed in
MTLn3 cells after inhibition of ROCK. Thus, Rho and ROCK suppress Rac-1 activation at the leading
edge, and inhibition of ROCK causes a switch between Cdc42 and Rac-1 as the dominant Rho GTPase
driving protrusion in carcinoma cells. These data describe a novel role for Rho in coordinating
signaling by Rac and Cdc42.

Introduction
Motility is a fundamental property of cells and is essential for physiological and pathological
events, including embryonic development, immune responses, wound healing, and tumor
metastasis. Motility towards a chemoattractant starts with the initial detection of a
chemoattractant source, which leads to the reorientation of the intracellular signaling
machinery such that the cell is committed to a given direction [1]. This is followed by the
localized extension of an actin-rich structure, such as a lamellipod, which propels the cell
towards the chemoattractant [2]. The steps that follow include adhesion of the lamellae to the
extracellular matrix, development of contractile force, de-adhesion of focal adhesions at the
tail of the cell, and contraction causing tail retraction toward the leading lamellae [3].
Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that couple the detection of chemoattractants to
actin polymerization [4]. Studies using constitutively active and dominant negative forms of
Rho GTPases have shown that, in some cells, Rac1, Cdc42 and Rho regulate the formation of
lamellipodia, filopodia and stress fibers, respectively [5]. Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate actin
polymerization through the indirect or direct activation of Scar/WAVE and WASP/N-WASP
nucleation promoting factors that activate the Arp2/3 complex [6,7]. Rho also plays a positive
role in the regulation of cell motility. Indeed, the inhibition of Rho, through the microinjection
of the Rho inhibitor, Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 (C3T), inhibits cell
motility in many cell systems [8,9]. Initially, the role of RhoA during cell motility was thought
to be restricted to the generation of contractile force and focal adhesion turnover needed for
tail retraction [10,11]. This is achieved through its downstream effector, the serine/threonine
kinase p160ROCK, which leads to myosin phosphorylation and actin-myosin contractility
[12]. Based on the antagonism between Rho/ROCK and Rac, it was originally postulated that
RhoA activity at the front of a migrating cell was incompatible with membrane protrusion
[10,13].
This model has been challenged by recent studies using fluorescence-based biosensors and
other methods to visualize the subcellular distribution of Rho GTPase activity [14–16]. Recent
reports have described a zone of RhoA/ROCK activation at the leading edge of cells [14,17–
19]. Although the precise role of RhoA at the leading edge of cells is still elusive, many
downstream effectors from RhoA could be directly involved in cell protrusion. Through
ROCK, RhoA leads to focal adhesion formation, which stabilizes the leading lamellae during
cell protrusion [20]. ROCK is required for myosin-based contractility at the front of invading
carcinoma cells [21]. RhoA/ROCK also phosphorylates and activates LIMK and could lead to
cofilin inhibition and actin filament stabilization [22]. Finally, RhoA signals to mDia, a potent
actin nucleator that could play a role in lamellipod formation [23].
In this report we examine the role of the Rho/p160ROCK pathway during actin-based
protrusion in EGF-stimulated carcinoma cells. We show that RhoA activation is kinetically
correlated with actin nucleation, and occurs in a broad band that extends throughout the
protruding lamellipod and into the lamellar region. Inhibition of Rho or p160ROCK leads to
increased protrusion but decreased motility. Moreover, inhibition of ROCK leads to a switch
in the Rho GTPase that regulates protrusion: protrusion in control MTLn3 requires Cdc42 but
not Rac, whereas protrusion in cells treated with ROCK inhibitor requires Rac-1 but not Cdc42.
Thus, activation of Rho/ROCK at the cell edge coordinates the coupling of Cdc42 and Rac-1
to the actin cytoskeleton.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells, MTLn3 cells, were cultured in α-MEM media
supplemented with 5% FBS as previously described [24]. MTC cells expressing the human
EGF receptor have been previously described [25]. For microscopy experiments, cells were
plated on coverslips coated with rat tail type 1 collagen (BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) or on
collagen-coated dishes (MatTek Corporation) 24 hours prior to the experiment. The cells were
then starved in L15 media (GIBCO BRL) with 0.35% BSA for 3 hours, and stimulated with a
final concentration of 5nM murine epidermal growth factor for various times (EGF; Upstate
biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY).
Antibodies and reagents
Mouse monoclonal anti-Rho antibody (clone 55), rabbit monoclonal anti-Rho antibody (clone
3L74), mouse monoclonal anti-Rac antibody (clone 23A8), and the mouse monoclonal anti-
Paxillin (clone 5H11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal anti-
Cdc42 antibody (sc-87) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The
Cy5-conjugated anti-biotin was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West
Grove, PA). Rhodamine Phalloidin, Alexa fluor 488-conjugated Dextran and fluorescent
secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The ROCK
inhibitor, Y27632, was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co (San Diego, CA). The
selective myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin, was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Wild
type Rac and RacQ61L were in eGFP-pcDNA3 vectors. The GFP-Vinculin was a generous
gift from Dr. Stefan Huettelmaier.
Cell Transfection with small interfering RNA
Rac1 siRNA [26] and Cdc42 siRNA[27] were previously described. The Rac1 siRNA oligo
was: 5′-AAAGAGAUCGGUGCUGUCAAA-3′. Alternatively, a collection of four siRNA
(Dharmicon Smartpools) was used. The Cdc42 siRNA oligo was: 5′-
AAAGACTCCTTTCTTGCTTGT-3′. MTLn3 cells were transfected with 100nM Rac or
Cdc42 siRNA or with control siRNA sequences targeting GL2 luciferase[28] (Ambion) for 48
hours prior to the day of the experiment using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer. Rac and Cdc42 suppression of protein levels was analyzed by Western blotting
using antibodies against total Rac and Cdc42 respectively.
Protein purification
pGEX-2T human PAK GTPase-binding domain (hPAK residues 67–150, CRIB domain),
pGEX-2T RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin (residues 7–89, RBD), pGEX-full length C3
transferase (Rho inhibitor, C3T a generous gift from Dr. Judy Meinkoth, Univ. Pennsylvania)
and the pGEX-full length Rho were expressed in Escherichia Coli as GST fusion proteins. The
proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The
purity and concentration of the proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue
staining.
Pull-down assays and Western Blots
MTLn3 cells were starved for 3 hours, stimulated with EGF for various times and stopped by
the addition of ice cold PBS containing with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The cells were lysed
and incubated with GST-CRIB (for Rac) or GST-RBD (for Rho). Rho and Rac were detected
by Western Blotting using the anti-Rho (rabbit) and anti-Rac antibodies, and imaged and
quantitated using a LICOR Odyssey system.

C3T inhibition of Rho
Cells were microinjected using an Eppendorf 5171/5242 semi-automatic micromanipulator/
microinjector. MTLn3 cells were starved for 2 hours then injected with 150 μg/ml of the C3T
protein along with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated Dextran or with 150 μg/ml IgG in PBS. The
cells were left to recover for 1 hour then stimulated with EGF.
Immunofluorescence
After EGF stimulation, cells were permeabilized with saponin and fixed as previously
described[29] for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, and aldehyde
autofluorescence was quenched with 1mg/ml NaBH4. For blocking, cells were incubated with
1% BSA/1%FBS in PBS for 30 min. Cells were stained with primary antibodies for 2 hours
and with secondary antibodies for 2 hours. For the pre-absorption experiments, cells were
stained with anti-Rho (mouse) pre-incubated in solution with GST alone or with GST-RhoA
for 1 hr at 4°C prior to staining. All fluorescent images were taken using a 60 X 1.4 NA infinity-
corrected optics on a Nikon Eclipse microscope supplemented with a computer-driven Roper
cooled CCD camera and operated by IPLab Spectrum software (VayTek). We have previously
shown, using atomic force microscopy, that the height of the lamellipod in EGF-stimulated
MTLn3 cells is approximately 600–800 nm (Rotsch et al., 2001). Thus, the entire lamellipod
is within one optical section and the use of confocal microscopy was not necessary. For image
analysis, all digital images were imported in image J software (National Institutes of Health,
USA). For fluorescent quantification, images were analyzed using a previously described
macro [30].
Live upshift and motility assay
For live protrusion analysis, starved cells were stimulated with EGF and analyzed by time-
lapse microscopy every 20 seconds. For motility analysis, images were collected every 60
seconds for 2 hours using a 20X objective in serum and their rate of movement quantitated
using ImageJ and DIAS computational software [31]. Optimal temperature and CO2 control
were maintained using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope mounted in an incubation
chamber.
RhoA FRET biosensor imaging and analysis
MTLn3 cells were transfected with 1μg of the RhoA fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET)-based biosensor plasmid [14], which shows an increase in FRET ratio with GTP-
loading of RhoA, using Fugene6 (Roche, Switzerland) for 24 hr as described by the
manufacturer. The biosensor consists of (from the N-terminus) the Rho binding domain (RBD)
of the effector Rhotekin, a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), a protease resistant 17mer
unstructured linker, a yellow florescent protein (YFP) domain, and a full length RhoA [14].
Activation of RhoA can be determined as a ratio of the FRET image over the CFP image
[32]. FRET image sequences were obtained with an automated Olympus IX70 microscope
equipped with filter wheels in the excitation and emission light path and coupled to a cooled
SensiCam QE CCD camera (Cooke Corp., MI). CFP was excited using a S430/25 filter with
a Sutter DG4 illuminator (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and the fluorescence detected with
a S470/30 (donor image) or S535/30 (FRET image) emission filter. YFP was imaged with
exciter S500/20 and emitter S535/30 (YFP image). In all cases a dual-band dichroic mirror
86002v2bs was used (Chroma Technology Corp., VT). Images were background corrected and
the YFP images were thresholded to generate a binary mask with values of 1 within the cell
and 0 for the background. Similar results were obtained when the mask was generated using
the YFP image to define the cell edge. This was used to remove the background from ratio
calculations, by multiplying CFP and FRET images by the mask. The increase in FRET signal
due to activation of RhoA was detected by dividing the FRET image (CFP excitation- YFP

emission) by the donor image (CFP excitation- CFP emission). Acquisition and FRET analyses
were done with IP Lab v3.51 (Scanalytics Inc., VA). Live FRET time-lapse movies were
collected using a DualView image splitter (Optical Insights, LLC, Tucson, AZ). The live
imaging was done with 4X4 binning to minimize exposure time, photobleaching and
registration artifacts. FRET signals were quantified by averaging the mean FRET ratio in
regions of interest in cells stimulated for various times. Procedures were based on those
previously described [14].
Results
Spatial and temporal analysis of Rho activation in EGF-stimulated carcinoma cells
In order to understand the involvement of RhoA in the events leading to cell protrusion, we
studied the kinetics and subcellular distribution of RhoA activation in MTLn3 carcinoma cells;
expression of RhoC is undetectable by western blot in these cells (data not shown). The
activation of total cellular Rho was examined in a pull-down assay using GST fused to the Rho
binding domain (RBD) from Rhotekin [33]. In EGF-stimulated MTLn3 cells, Rho followed a
biphasic activation profile (Fig 1A), with an initial peak of activation at 60 seconds. Rho
activation dropped to near basal levels by 100 seconds, but then increased again after 180
seconds of EGF stimulation. These kinetics coincide with the kinetics of actin polymerization
in MTLn3 cells, which also shows transients at 1 and 3 minutes [2]. Interestingly, the
localization of Rho at 1 versus 3 min was different. At 1 min, Rho was localized to a narrow
band that extended approximately 0.5 μm into the cell (Fig 1B middle panel), which is the zone
of f-actin accumulation in EGF-stimulated MTLn3 cells [34]. We presume that this is staining
pattern is largely due to RhoA, since RhoB is confined to endosomes [35]. However, by 3
minutes, anti-Rho staining is localized to a broader region that began approximately 0.5 μm
behind the leading edge and extended 2 μm into the cell (Fig. 1B right panel). Previous studies
have suggested that this zone includes the tropomyosin-rich lamellar region [30,36]. Anti-Rho
staining was also observed in numerous punctate structures, which could result from RhoB in
endosomal structures. These data are consistent with previous observations of a small fraction
of RhoA in the plasma membrane [35]. Anti-Rho staining was specific, as it was abolished by
pre-absorption with GST-RhoA (Fig 1C) but not GST (data not shown).
To directly visualize active RhoA in carcinoma cells, we used a single chain CFP/YFP FRET
biosensor (Fig. S1A) [14]. Control experiments demonstrated that the probe for RhoA
activation is inhibited by microinjection of C3T (Fig S1B and S1C), and that biosensor
expression does not perturb EGF-stimulated cytoskeletal responses (S1D). Analysis of the
FRET signal at various probe expression levels revealed a slight increase at high levels of probe
expression (Fig S1E). Analysis was therefore restricted to cells expressing moderate levels of
the biosensor (≤ 400 a.u./cell).
We first analyzed RhoA activation in MTLn3 cells under steady-state conditions, moving
randomly in 5% serum, using live time-lapse FRET ratio imaging. RhoA activation was found
to localize to the protruding edges of spontaneously moving cells (Figure 1D, upper panel and
Supplemental movie S1). These images unambiguously define newly formed protrusion, and
confirm the localization of RhoA to these sites. In order to obtain higher temporal resolution
of RhoA activation, we collected time-lapse images of cells after acute EGF stimulation. RhoA
activation was biphasic, with peaks of activity at 1 and 3 min at the tip of actively protruding
lamellipodia (Figure 1D, lower panel, Fig. 1E, and Supplemental Movie S2).
Inhibition of the Rho/ROCK pathway leads to decreased motility but enhanced protrusion
The finding of RhoA activation at the front of protruding MTLn3 cells suggested a role in
motility that is not confined to the regulation of tail retraction. We therefore tested the effects

of inhibiting Rho and its downstream effector p160ROCK [37] on cell motility. Inhibition of
either Rho by microinjection of cells with C3T led to a substantial decrease in cell motility in
serum (Table 1). Similarly results were obtained in cells treated with the ROCK inhibitor
Y27632. (Although Y27632 inhibits Rock-I, Rock-II, and PRK, its affects on wound healing
and protrusion are mimicked by knockdown of ROCK-I but not ROCK-II or PRK-2 [38]).
Whereas control cells undergoing cell motility in serum extended lamellipodia preferentially
in the direction of movement, the C3T-injected cells and the Y27632-treated cells protruded
in all directions and adopted a round flat morphology, which led to the cells being nearly
stationary (Supplemental movies S3 and S4).
We next measured the effect of Rho/ROCK inhibition on acute EGF-stimulated protrusion.
MTLn3 cells stimulated with EGF show an increase in cell area due to actin-mediated
protrusion. In contrast, MTLn3 cells microinjected with the Rho inhibitor C3T showed a basal
cell area that was comparable to the final area of control EGF-stimulated cells; C3T-injected
cells extended only slightly more in response to EGF (Figure 2A and 2B). Actin staining of
the EGF-stimulated C3T-microinjected cells showed a loss of actin stress fibers, but still show
an accumulation of F-actin at the cell edge (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that inhibition of Rho
is sufficient to induce protrusion in MTLn3 cells. A related phenotype was seen in cells treated
with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632. While treatment of cells with Y27632 had no effect on the
cell area of unstimulated cells, Y27632-treated cells showed hyperextension in response to
EGF stimulation (Figures 2C, 2D). This phenotype was not seen in a previous study using
lower doses of Y27632 that were sufficient to inhibit cofilin phosphorylation but only partially
inhibited ROCK, as assessed by residual EGF-stimulated LIM kinase phosphorylation [39].
Thus, inhibition of Rho or ROCK led to basal or EGF-stimulated hyperextension, respectively.
The broad area of RhoA activation that we detected after 3 min of EGF stimulation is similar
to the localization of phosphorylated myosin light chain, which is regulated by myosin light
chain kinase and ROCK [40]. To test whether the effect of Rho/ROCK inhibition on protrusion
was due to a disruption of the contractile apparatus, we treated the cells with the myosin light
chain kinase inhibitor ML-7. However, no changes in basal or EGF-stimulated protrusion were
observed (Fig. S2.A); controls showed that the drug was active, as it blocked myosin light
chain phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S2.B) [41]. Similarly, we
saw no effects on overall EGF receptor signaling, as measured by activation of Akt and Erk
(Fig. S2.C).
Inhibition of ROCK hyperactivates Rac
The hyperprotrusion caused by inhibition of ROCK (Fig. 3A, panel 3) resembles the phenotype
of MTLn3 cells expressing constitutively active Rac1, which leads to constitutive protrusion
(Fig. 3A, panel 4) but decreased motility (Table 2). We therefore tested whether Rho inhibition
might enhance protrusion through affects on Rac1 (Rac 2 and Rac 3 expression is barely
detectable in MTLn3 cells [26]). MTLn3 cells microinjected with C3T (Fig. 3B, right panels)
or treated with the ROCK inhibitor (Fig. 3C, right panels) showed a pronounced increase in
Rac localization to the cell edge after 3 minutes of EGF stimulation. Rac localized to a broad
area that spans the newly formed protrusion, reminiscent of the localization of activated RhoA
in cells stimulated with EGF for 3 minutes (Figure 1B). The enhanced Rac localization at the
cell edge reflected an increase in Rac activation, as measured by a Rac pull-down assay (Fig.
3D). In contrast, neither Cdc42 localization (data not shown) nor activation (Fig. S3) were
affected by ROCK inhibition, similar to results in fibroblasts [42].
Rac mediates the formation of focal complexes, which then undergo Rho-mediated maturation
into focal adhesions [13]. Given the hyperactivation of Rac in Y27632-treated cells, we
examined the effects of ROCK inhibition of the EGF-stimulated formation of adhesive
structures. In control cells stimulated with EGF for 3 min and stained for paxillin, a mixture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
of focal complexes at the cell periphery and focal adhesions in the lamellar region of the cell
can be seen (Fig. 4A, top panels). However, treatment of cells with Y27632 lead to a marked
increase in focal complexes and a near total loss of focal adhesions (Figure 4A, bottom panels).
The increase in focal complexes was presumably due to Rac hyperactivation, since knockdown
of Rac1 abolished focal complex formation and focal adhesions in both control and Y27632-
treated cells (Fig. 4B).
Inhibition of ROCK leads to a switch from Cdc42-dependent to Rac1-dependent protrusion
We have previously shown that in control MTLn3 cells, EGF-stimulated protrusion is
unaffected by knockdown of Rac1 [43], but is inhibited by knockdown of Cdc42 [24]. Given
the dramatic increase in Rac1 activation caused by inhibition of ROCK, we tested whether the
functional roles of Rac and Cdcd42 were altered in Y27632-treated cells. As previously noted,
knockdown of Rac1 (Fig. 5A) has minimal effect on protrusion in MTLn3 cells (Figure 5C,
white versus light grey bars). However, protrusion in the presence of Y27632 was markedly
suppressed by Rac1 knockdown (Figure 5B, and 5C, dark grey versus black bars). These data
were replicated using a distinct pool of four Rac1 siRNA oligos (Fig. S4A). Similarly, as
previously reported, knockdown of Cdc42 in control MTLn3 cells markedly suppresses EGF-
stimulated protrusion (Fig. 6B, white versus light grey bars). However, Cdc42 knockdown
cells treated with Y27632 still showed enhanced protrusion relative to control cells (Fig. 6A
and 6B, black versus white bars). Some inhibition of protrusion by Cdc42 knockdown is seen
at 1 min, but this may be secondary to an inhibition of Rac membrane translocation that is seen
at 1 but not 3 min (Fig. S4B). As previously shown [24], Cdc42 knockdown in control MTLn3
cells leads to a complete loss of the lamellipodial region, as the tropomyosin-rich lamellar
region [30,36] extends to the cell edge (Fig. 6C, left panels). In contrast, the tropomyosin free,
Arp2/3-rich lamellipodial compartment is clearly visible in both control and Cdc42 knockdown
cells treated with Y27632 (Fig. 6C, right hand panels). Thus, Cdc42 is required for protrusion
and maintenance of normal lamellipodial architecture is control cells, and this dependence is
eliminated by inhibition of ROCK.
MTC cells show decreased Rho activation and Rac-dependent protrusion
To test the hypothesis that Cdc42-dependent and Rac-independent protrusion in MTLn3 cells
is related to high Rho activity, we examined the related non-metastatic carcinoma line, MTC
[44,45]. MTC cells have previously been shown to move faster and to be more intrinsically
polarized than MTLn3 cells [46]. Since native MTC cells do not respond to EGF, we used cells
expressing the EGF receptor [25].
As shown in Fig. 7A and Supplemental Movie S5, MTC cells moving in serum show decreased
levels of RhoA activation at the edge of protrusions as compared to MTLn3 cells. Similarly,
both GTP-bound and total Rho is decreased in MTC cells relative to MTLn3 cells in a pull-
down assay (Fig. 7B). We next tested whether inhibition of ROCK would lead to an increase
in Rac activation, as it did in MTLn3 cells. Interestingly, we found that Rac activity in MTC
cells was elevated as compared to MTLn3 cells, and was unaffected by inhibition of ROCK;
EGF-stimulated Rac activity in MTC cells was similar to EGF-Rac activity in Y27632-treated
MTLn3 cells. Thus, in MTC cells we find decreased RhoA activity, increased Rac activity,
and a failure of ROCK inhibition to lead to additional activation Rac.
Given that finding of low RhoA activity and high Rac activity in MTC cells relative to MTLn3
cells, we tested whether Rac would be required for protrusion in MTC cells. We knocked down
Rac1 expression in MTC cells (Fig. 7D) and recorded time-lapse images of control or Rac1
siRNA-treated cells (Supplemental Movie S6; representative images in Fig. 7E). MTC cells
treated with Rac1 siRNA were less well spread than cells treated with control siRNA, and in
contrast to MTLn3 cells [26], showed a marked decrease in EGF-stimulated protrusion (Fig.
El-Sibai et al. Page 7

7F). Thus, in MTLn3 cells, where we find increased RhoA activity and decreased Rac activity,
protrusion is Cdc42-dependent and Rac-independent [24,26]; Rac activity and Rac-dependent
protrusion is restored upon inhibition of ROCK (Fig. 6). In contrast, MTC cells exhibit
decreased RhoA activity, increased Rac activity, and Rac-dependent protrusion (Fig. 7). These
data suggest that RhoA-mediated inhibition of Rac activity determines the relative contribution
of Rac and Cdc42 to EGF-stimulated protrusion.
Discussion
In this report, we have examined the role of RhoA in MTLn3 rat adenocarcinoma cells. We
find that RhoA follows a biphasic activation profile in EGF-stimulated cells, with an early
activation peak at 1 minute and a late phase of activation after 3 minutes. Thus, RhoA activation
is coincident with barbed end formation in MTLn3 cells in response to EGF stimulation [2].
The finding of activated RhoA in EGF-stimulated protrusions is consistent with recent reports
implicating RhoA activity at the leading edge of moving cells [17,19,47,48].
In MTLn3 carcinoma cells, EGF-stimulated lamellipodial protrusion requires activation of Ras
and Cdc42, but not Rac [24,43]. This is in contrast to fibroblasts, where Rac but not Cdc42 is
the major positive regulator of protrusion [5]. Interestingly, we find that Rho and ROCK are
not required for protrusion, and their inhibition in fact leads to an increase in protrusion. Instead,
Rho and ROCK regulate the coupling of Rac versus Cdc42 to the protrusive machinery. Thus,
in control MTLn3 cells, knockdown of Cdc42 but not Rac inhibits protrusion, whereas in
Y27632-treated MTLn3 cells, knockdown of Rac1 but not Cdc42 blocks protrusion. The Rho/
ROCK-mediated maintenance of Cdc42-dependent protrusion is apparently due to its
inhibition of Rac-1, since inhibition of ROCK markedly increases Rac1 activity but has little
effect on Cdc42. Rho-Rac antagonism has been observed in other cell models [49] and may
reflect activation of a Rac GAP such as FilGAP, which is activated by RhoA and ROCK
[50]. However, a role for Rho in switching a cell between Cdc42- versus Rac-mediated
protrusion has not been previously described.
The phenotypes of Rho and ROCK inhibition are not identical: Rho inhibition led to
constitutive circumferential protrusion, whereas ROCK inhibition led to an exaggeration of
EGF-stimulated protrusion. This difference presumably reflects the contribution of additional
downstream Rho effectors that are not affected by inhibition of ROCK, which might inhibit
protrusion under basal conditions but enhance protrusion during EGF stimulation.
Despite increased protrusion, inhibition of Rho or ROCK leads to decreased motility in 2D
culture, consistent with data from colon cancer cells [51] but different from studies in MDA-
MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells [52]. The loss of motility in C3T- or Y27632-treated MTLn3
cells could be in part due to excessive Rac activation, as expression of a constitutively active
Rac mutant in MTLn3 (Table 2) and other cells lines [53] leads to a symmetrical,
circumferential protrusion and decreased motility. The effects of Rho/ROCK inhibition on
motility could also be due in part to changes in the regulation of adhesive structures, as
maturation of focal adhesions is blocked by inhibition of ROCK, consistent with previous
studies [13].
Our data suggest a model in which variation in the amplitude of RhoA signaling can regulate
motility through its inhibitory effects of Rac1. Thus, cells with lower levels of RhoA activity
may show an increased Rac activity and a greater dependence on Rac for control of protrusion.
Consistent with this model, we find that MTC carcinoma cells, a non-metastatic cell line closely
related to MTLn3 cells, shows lower RhoA activity, higher Rac activity, and Rac-dependent
protrusion. Thus, variation in the amplitude of Rho/ROCK activation in response to
chemotactic stimuli may orchestrate the relative roles of Rac1 and Cdc42 during protrusion.
