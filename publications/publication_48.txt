Abstract
Background: The process of neurite outgrowth is the initial step in producing the neuronal processes that wire the brain.
Current models about neurite outgrowth have been derived from classic two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems, which
do not recapitulate the topographical cues that are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM)in vivo. Here, we explore how
ECM nanotopography influences neurite outgrowth.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that, when the ECM protein laminin is presented on a line pattern with
nanometric size features, it leads to orientation of neurite outgrowth along the line pattern. This is also coupled with a
robust increase in neurite length. The sensing mechanism that allows neurite orientation occurs through a highly
stereotypical growth cone behavior involving two filopodia populations. Non-aligned filopodia on the distal part of the
growth cone scan the pattern in a lateral back and forth motion and are highly unstable. Filopodia at the growth cone tip
align with the line substrate, are stabilized by an F-actin rich cytoskeleton and enable steady neurite extension. This
stabilization event most likely occurs by integration of signals emanating from non-aligned and aligned filopodia which
sense different extent of adhesion surface on the line pattern. In contrast, on the 2D substrate only unstable filopodia are
observed at the growth cone, leading to frequent neurite collapse events and less efficient outgrowth.
Conclusions/Significance: We propose that a constant crosstalk between both filopodia populations allows stochastic
sensing of nanotopographical ECM cues, leading to oriented and steady neurite outgrowth. Our work provides insight in
how neuronal growth cones can sense geometric ECM cues. This has not been accessible previously using routine 2D
culture systems.

Introduction
Proper functioning of the nervous system requires functional
connections between neurons. This requires undifferentiated
neurons to extend neurites that will subsequently differentiate in
axons and dendrites to wire the adult brain. Studying the complex
morphogenetic event of neurite outgrowth is not only important
for understanding the development of the nervous system, but also
tissue regeneration after nerve injury and the treatment of
neuropathological conditions. Until now most of the work on
neurite outgrowth at the cell biology level has been done using
routine 2-dimensional (2D) culture systems. However,in vivo, cells
interact with complex 3-dimensional anisotropic environments
that display a different topology from the isotropic 2D environ-
ment. In this context, multiple ECM proteins are capable of
forming large structures with different geometrical and size
features ranging from tens of nanometers to micrometers. The
highly organized structure of the ECM is essential for cell and
tissue morphogenesis and remodeling [1]. By example, parallel
bundles of collagen fibrils are found in connective tissues [2] and
laminins assemble basement membrane structures [3]. Laminin
tracks on the surface of Schwann cells are also important for
neurite outgrowth and neuronal regeneration after a lesion [4]. In
this case, laminin most likely assembles fibrillar structures [5].
Furthermore, in the developing nervous system, axons often
follow ECM tracks that are oriented along structures such a
blood vessels [6]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that precise
topological features of the ECM are important for the cell’s ability
to interact with and perceive its environment. However, the
importance of the ECM organization and topography at the
micro- and nano-meter scale is still poorly understood. With recent
technological advances in microfabrication, this now becomes
accessible [7,8]. Multiple reports document that the processes
of cell migration or of the extension of neuronal processes
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 12 | e15966
from neurons are highly dependent on the geometrical topology of
the surrounding ECM.
Neurons have been reported to respond to different ECM
topologies in terms of morphology. When laminin is presented on
aligned nanofiber scaffolds, neuronal processes can orient along
these fibers compared to randomly oriented scaffolds [9]. Similar
alignment behavior has also been observed when neurons are
plated on micrometric laminin lines [10]. When human
embryonic stem cells are plated on specific nanopatterns, they
can effectively and rapidly differentiate into a neuronal lineage
without the use of differentiation-inducing agents [11,12,13].
Thus, ECM nanoscale topography not only regulates cell
morphology but also cell fate. While the combination of such
nanotopographic cues with biochemical cues such as retinoic acid
further enhances neuronal differentiation, nanotopography
showed a stronger effect compared to retinoic acid alone on an
unpatterned surface [13]. The mechanisms by which nanotopo-
graphic ECM cues influence differentiation appear to involve
changes in cytoskeletal organization and structure, potentially in
response to the geometry and size of the underlying features of the
ECM. This might influence the clustering of integrins in focal
adhesions and the formation of actin stress fibers, and thus the
adhesion and spreading of cells. Secondary effects, such as
alterations in the effective stiffness perceived by the cell or
differences in protein adsorption due to the structural features of
the substrate are also possible [14]. However, the cellular
mechanisms of cell fate control by ECM nanotopography remain
largely unexplored.
One of the best characterized example of control of cell
behavior by ECM topology has been observed during fibroblast
cell migration [15]. It is well described that fibroblasts migrate
about 1.5 times faster on ECM fibrils in 3D cell-derived matrices
compared to the same ECM presented in a classic 2D
environment. In this study, 1D micro-patterned ECM lines with
precise size features (1–2 mm width) have been shown to
recapitulate the cell migration behavior observed in cell-derived
3D ECM environments. This most likely occurs because these
ECM lines are able to mimic the fibrillar nature of the ECM in a
3D environment. Importantly, such a pseudo 3D environment has
provided a convenient platform to analyze cell migration using
microscopy techniques that do not require confocality. This has
given novel insight about the molecular mechanisms of how cells
perceive and migrate in 3D versus 2D environments. Comparable
results have also been observed during cell migration on similar
patterns at the nanometer scale [16].
In this study, we sought to understand the molecular
mechanisms of how neurons respond to matrix nanotopography
during the process of neurite outgrowth. For that purpose, we
explored in detail neuronal morphology and morphodynamics on
nanopatterns. We find that when cells are challenged with a highly
defined anisotropic, nanotopographic laminin substrate, distinct
neurite outgrowth responses occur in comparison with the classic,
isotropic 2D environment. Our data suggest that growth cone
filopodia are the organelles that allow to sense these nanotopo-
graphic ECM cues to orient neurite outgrowth. Importantly, we
find that oriented outgrowth is also coupled with steady neurite
outgrowth. This allows for more robust neurite outgrowth on the
nanotopographical versus the 2D ECM.
Results
To explore how ECM nanotopology can regulate neurite
outgrowth, we used ultraviolet-assisted capillary force lithography
to construct ridge/groove pattern arrays on glass coverslips
[17,18]. Here, liquid polyurethane acrylate (PUA) is coated on a
plasma-treated glass coverslip to which a PUA mold is applied
(Fig. 1A). The cavities of this mold are filled by PUA through
capillary force which is then cured by exposure to UV light. We
fabricated different topographic patterns that were composed of
arrays of parallel ridges that are 350 nm wide and 350 nm high,
separated by grooves of 1, 2, 3, 5 times 350 nm width increments
(1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5 patterns). The fidelity with which we are able to
produce such line patterns is illustrated by scanning electron
micrographs (SEM) (Fig. 1B). We then used differentiated N1E-
115 cells as a model system to compare the neurite outgrowth
responses on classic 2D, laminin-coated coverslip (plain substrate)
versus laminin that is presented on these line patterns (line
substrate). Using fluorescently-labeled laminin, we found that this
protein homogeneously coated the topographical patterns (Fig.
S1A).
To evaluate the neurite outgrowth responses, we stained the
microtubule cytoskeleton and the nuclei of the cells at different
time points after plating and used automated image analysis to
measure neurite length and orientation on the plain and line
substrates (Fig. S1B). We observed that neurites align in the
direction of the line pattern, whereas they extend randomly on the
plain substrate (Fig. 1C and D). This orientation was not
dependent on the spacing of the lines. Second, we found that
the line pattern led to an increase in neurite length (Fig. 1C and E)
which increases with groove width and peaks on the 1:3 and 1:5
patterns. As a control, we also evaluate a 1:40 pattern, and found
that neurite outgrowth was still oriented, was less robust than on
the 1:3 and 1:5 patterns, but still more robust than on plain
substrate (data not shown). Laminin coating of normal coverslips
or coverslips that have been covered with a homogeneous PUA
layer yielded similar results, showing that these different cell
responses were not dependent on PUA (data not shown).
Importantly, the size features of the ridges on the line substrate
are smaller than a growth cone. Furthermore, we observed that
the neurite is slightly deflected compared to the ridge direction.
Orientation of neurite outgrowth does therefore not happen by
physical trapping of the neurite in the grooves. Thus, the simple
fact of altering the topographical state of which an ECM is
presented to the cell drastically alters neurite orientation and
outgrowth. Neurite orientation not only occurred with our
neuronal-like neuroblastoma cell line, but similar results were also
observed with freshly isolated primary cortical neurons that were
plated on a 1:5 line substrate coated with poly-L-ornithine and
laminin (Fig. S2).
We next thought to understand the cellular mechanisms that
allow the specific neuronal cell responses on the line substrate. For
that purpose, we used the 1:5 line substrate throughout this study
since it leads to the most robust phenotype in terms of neurite
length. We first immunostained the cells on plain and 1:5 line
substrates to visualize the F-actin and tubulin cytoskeletons 2 and
24 hours after plating (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, we found that a
higher amount of filopodia was typically observed on the soma,
neurite shaft and growth cone of cells on plain versus line
substrate. Quantitation revealed a two fold increase of filopodia
number on the neurite shaft on plain versus line substrate (Fig. 2B
and C). These filopodia were also longer (Fig. 2B and D). While
growth cones were highly spread and displayed a high density of
randomly oriented filopodia on plain substrate, less spread,
streamlined growth cones with fewer filopodia occurred on line
substrate. These growth cones exhibited thick filopodia that
aligned in the direction of the pattern ridges and displayed a high
F-actin content as observed by phalloidin staining (Fig. 2A and E).
This was especially evident with high resolution images of growth

cones on the line substrate, and, in addition to the thick, F-actin
rich aligned filopodia revealed a second population of thin, F-actin
poor filopodia that were not aligned with the lines (Fig. 2F).
Similar results were also observed in SEM experiments and
revealed that thick filopodia align and intimately adhere along the
top of the line ridges (Fig. 2G, red arrows), whereas thin, unaligned
filopodia only interact with the line ridges at discrete points
(Fig. 2G, black arrows).
We then used phase contrast time-lapse microscopy to study the
morphodynamics of neurite outgrowth on plain and line
substrates. We observed that neurites exhibited a highly unstable
behavior that consisted of multiple cycles of neurite protrusion and
retraction events on the plain substrate (Fig. 3A, Movies S1 and
S2). In the early phases of the process, this often resulted in re-
absorption of the neurite by the cell soma which was followed by
the creation of a new initiation site and the outgrowth of a new
neurite. In contrast, on the line pattern, neurites almost never
retracted and thus outgrowth was steady (Fig. 3A). We tracked
neurite tip trajectories and found that neurite outgrowth on plain
substrate typically occurred for a period of 30 min before a
retraction event occurred (Fig. 3B and C). This neurite extension
lifetime was extended to 180 minutes on the line substrate with
retraction events typically occurring at neurite branch points
(Fig. 3C). This allowed for the elimination of the branch points
and led the cell to adopt two unbranched neuronal processes that
align in the direction of the line pattern. We found that neurite tip
velocity was only modestly increased on the line versus plain
substrate (Fig. 3D). Soma motility was also affected. On plain
substrate, the soma displayed a highly motile behavior (average
speed = 60mm/hour) consisting of random bursts of migratory
behavior. On the line substrate, cells were much less motile
(average speed = 20mm/hour) (Fig. S3, Movie S2). Thus, the line
substrate not only allows neurite orientation, but also switches off
the dynamic unstable behavior of neurites and the motile behavior
of cells observed on plain substrate.
The most marked differences in morphological responses of
neuronal like cells in response to the plain versus the line pattern
are observed at the level of the filopodia which have been
proposed to work as sensors to guide neuronal growth cones [19].
Thus, we performed high resolution time-lapse microscopy
experiments in which we visualized F-actin dynamics using the
Lifeact-GFP probe [20], which allows for a high contrast on
filopodia (Fig. 4A). On plain substrate, filopodia directly at the
growth cone or the neurite shaft extend randomly in multiple
directions, perform a typical lateral back and forth motion and
then retract. This is accompanied with dynamic neurite protru-
sion/retraction cycles in multiple directions as described above
(Fig. 4A, Movie S3). On the line substrate, we found that the two
growth cone filopodia populations displayed different dynamic
behaviors (Fig. 4A,B,C, Movies S3 and S4). Filopodia located at
the growth cone tip that aligned on the ridges were stable and
contained high amounts of F-actin reflected by elevated Lifeact-
GFP signal, compared to the non-aligned filopodia (Fig. 4C). Non-
aligned filopodia situated on the distal part of the growth cone and
throughout the neurite shaft displayed a highly unstable behavior
and contained less F-actin (Fig. 4D, Movie S4). To quantitate the
dynamics of these different filopodia populations, we tracked their
angular evolution. We found that filopodia that are oriented along
the lines remained so for hours. In contrast, non-aligned filopodia
extend from the neurite shaft with an angle relative to the lines,
scan the pattern using a lateral back and forth motion relative to
the neurite shaft and then retract, the whole cycle being on the
order of five to ten minutes (Fig. 4D, filopodia outlines by red and
blue lines, angular motion quantified in Fig. 4E). We also observed
that the stochastic search and capture motion performed by these
non-aligned filopodia eventually led to their alignement on a ridge
of the line substrate. This then subsequently led to the assembly of
a robust F-actin cytoskeleton in the newly aligned filopodium
(Fig. 4D, filopodia outlined by the blue line). The highly stable
extension of aligned filopodia was also apparent with kymograph
analyses (Fig. 4F). Occasionally, we also observed some neurites
that were not oriented in the direction of the line substrate (Movie
S5). These only exhibited unstable filopodia that stochastically
scan the pattern through continuous protrusion/retraction cycles
coupled with lateral motion, until they finally aligned along a
pattern ridge and produced stable, F-actin rich filopodia at the
growth cone. These results suggest that filopodia are the organelles
that allow sensing of the line substrate through a stochastic
filopodia-mediated search and capture mechanism.
Because neuronal guidance in response to immobilized laminin
has been reported to require mechanosensing through myosin
activation [21], we also explored if contractility is important for
neurite orientation in our system through inhibition of Rho kinase
or of myosin II ATPase activity (using the Y-27632 and
blebbistatin drugs). We observed an increase in neurite length at
24 hours in response to any of the two inhibitors, on both plain
and line substrates (Fig. 5A and B). Both drug treatments did not,
however, lead to a loss of the ability of the neurite to orient itself on
the line substrate (Fig. 5A and C). These drug treatments led to
morphological changes of the neurites on the plain substrate in
that many neurite tips displayed highly spread, fan-shaped growth
cones (Fig. 5D, compare growth cones with those of Fig. 2F), as
reported earlier [22,23]. This was however not observed on the
line pattern on which streamlined growth cones with F-actin rich
filopodia were still observed. To get insight into the signaling
mechanisms that allow the orientation and the steady neurite
outgrowth response of the neuronal like cells on the line pattern,
we explored if there are global differences in signaling activities in
response to ECM topography. For that purpose, we probed lysates
of differentiated cells plated on plain or line substrate using
western blot analysis for different signaling activities. We
performed this experiment at 2 hours when robust initiation of
neurite outgrowth is observed, and at 24 hours, when very long
but less dynamic neurites occur. We examined post-translational
modifications that impact on microtubule stability (microtubule
detyrosination and acetylation), MAP kinase signaling (ERK
phosphorylation) and adhesion signals (phospho myosin light
chain, phospho-FAK and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins). We
could not find any obvious differences in signal intensity between
plain and line substrates (Fig. S4). Thus the differences in neurite
morphodynamics are most likely dependent on highly localized
signaling events involving minute pools of signaling molecules in

Discussion
The traditional systems to study neuronal differentiation and the
outgrowth of neuronal processes have taken advantage of classic
cell culture systems in which ECM proteins are coated
homogeneously over 2D surfaces. This is unlikely to recapitulate
the neuronal responses occurringin vivo in which the ECM is
assembled into precise structures which have size features on the
nano-meter scale. We find that providing neurons with an
anisotropic ECM line substrate, which most likely mimics some
topological features ofin vivo ECM structures, is sufficient to orient
neurite outgrowth. Importantly, this is also coupled with a robust
increase in neurite outgrowth. Similar responses have already been
observed with a variety of different nanometric patterns [9,24,25],
but a cellular mechanism remained unclear.In vivo, similar fibrillar
laminin tracks are observed on the surface of Schwann cells, and
have been showed to be important for neurite outgrowth and
neuronal regeneration after a lesion [4,5]. Our results that show
different neuronal morphologies and morphodynamics in response
to the line versus the plain substrate, suggest that oriented neurite
outgrowth on the line substrate is the result of a sensing
mechanism performed by filopodia. Filopodia are excellent devices
to sense the line substrate since they are rigid, rod-like structures
that cannot bend and adhere to the grooves of the pattern, and
have similar size features than the pattern ridges (filopodia width
= 200–500 nm [26]). They might thus discern if they are aligned
or not on the pattern ridges, by evaluating the contact area
between the filopodia and the pattern ridges (Fig. 5). Our SEM
experiments suggest that non-aligned filopodia only form discrete
contacts with ECM molecules on the top of ridges, whereas
aligned filopodia can form a more intimate interaction zone with
the ridges (Fig. 2G, depicted in Fig. 6A and B). Our time-lapse
datasets (Fig. 4) suggest that non-aligned filopodia stochastically
scan the line substrate through a process that occurs on a timescale
of a couple of minutes, and consists of cycles of protrusion–
retraction events that are coupled with a back and forth lateral
motion. This is repeated until a filopodium aligns on the pattern
ridge which subsequently leads to the assembly of a robust F-actin
network and an extensive contact zone with the ridge (Movies S4
and S5, Fig. 6A and B). This then enables to switch off the
dynamic unstable behavior observed in non-aligned filopodia,
allowing to filopodium stabilization for hours, and ultimately
leading to steady neurite outgrowth.
The two distinct filopodial behaviors we observe most likely
depend on different levels of coupling between the substrate and
the cytoskeleton as proposed in the ‘‘molecular clutch model’’
[27]. Extensive interaction of aligned filopodia with the substrate,
might allow a much more efficient cytoskeletal coupling than in
non-aligned filopodia, leading to constant filopodial protrusion
(e.g. the clutch is continually engaged). In this case, the formation
of a robust F-actin network might allow to counteract the actin
retrograde flow in the aligned filopodium, leading to its
stabilization. In unaligned filopodia, less stable substrate-cytoskel-
etal coupling might occur, due to the limited interaction with the
ECM. In this case, filopodia retraction might occur because strong
retrograde flow exceeds actin assembly at the filopodium tip [28]
(e.g. the clutch engages and then rapidly disengages). Obviously, in
our purely ECM driven system, integrins are the sensors that allow
to interprete the line pattern. Consistently, conformationally
activated, but unligated integrins have been observed in filopodia
of neuronal growth cones [29] and might allow to sense the extent
of filopodium contact. One important question is then which
signaling events downstream of the integrins allow the formation
and maintenance of the robust F-actin network observed in
aligned filopodia that allows stabilization of the molecular clutch.

A first hint is that this does not occur on the plain substrate, on
which each filopodium senses an identical amount of laminin. This
suggests that on the line pattern, formation of the robust F-actin
network requires integration of spatially regulated adhesive signals
from the aligned filopodia at the growth cone tip and from the
non-aligned filopodia that are continuously operating on the distal
part of the growth cone. However, the signaling events occurring
downstream of these receptors remain elusive and our whole-cell
measurements of signaling activities certainly could not resolve the
precise spatio-temporal regulation of minute pools of signaling
molecules in the growth cone that is relevant to this system (Fig.
S4). Understanding the signal amplification events that allow the

formation of this F-actin rich network will therefore requires
advanced live cell imaging techniques that allow to resolve their
spatio-temporal dynamics in the growth cone. At the structural
level, one can also wonder about the actin binding proteins that
allow F-actin stabilization in aligned filopodia? Prime candidates
are proteins such as Fascin and Ena/Vasp that enable to crosslink
actin filaments into bundles, or myosin-X, a motor protein which
seems to be important in localization of filopodial components to
the filopodium tip [30].
The specific neuronal guidance mode that we observe on ECM
nanotopographic cues is distinct from directional sensing in
response to soluble chemo-attractants and –repellants. Rather
than the search and capture mechanism, chemotactic growth cone
guidance occurs through local stabilization of filopodia most
proximal to the attractant source and collapse of those that are
distant of the source, leading to net turning in the direction of the
chemoattractant [31]. To our knowledge, this has not been shown
to involve a robust F-actin network, and illustrates differences
between chemotactic and ECM sensing. In vivo, our filopodial
search and capture mechanism might therefore allow a basal
orientation mechanism along ECM tracks. Additional superposi-
tion of gradients of soluble cues might allow to fine tune axonal
guidance by inducing growth cone turning at regions such as the
midline [32]. Importantly, the filopodia search and capture
mechanism that we describe is highly reminiscent of growth cone
behavior observedin vivo. Live imaging of growth cone dynamicsin
vivo shows similar morphodynamics as for our cells on the line
substrate. By example, Xenopus retinal axons display a stream-
lined growth cone with lateral filopodia that display identical
protrusion-retraction behavior coupled with lateral motion than
we observe with the non-aligned filopodia on the line pattern [33].
This is accompanied with steady growth without retractions
events. Similar growth cone morphologies have also been observed
in vivoin retinal axons in the mouse [34] or in zebrafish [35]. These
different lines of evidence suggest that the precise ECM
nanotopology on our line substrate recapitulates geometric
features of thein vivo ECM.
This raises the issue that the classic 2D substrate does not
faithfully reflect the ECM cues that are experiencedin vivo, as well
as the intracellular signaling events that are triggered by the ECM.
On classic 2D substrates, unrestricted access to adhesion sites leads
to an increase in filopodia length and number on growth cones,
neurite shafts and somata. An immediate consequence is that
filopodia, owing to their high density and their high adhesive state,
cannot perform the highly dynamic behavior of protrusion-
retraction coupled with lateral scanning (Fig. 6C). Furthermore
they cannot assemble stable, F-actin rich filopodia, most likely
because the lack of anisotropy in the ECM that is needed for cell
polarization and the production of both filopodia populations.
This inability to produce F-actin rich filopodia will then lead to the
growth cone collapse events that induce the characteristic
protrusion/retraction cycles occurring during neurite outgrowth
on the plain substrate. Such protrusion retraction cycles have been
documented in multiple neuronal systems, such as by example

with stage 2 immature neurites in the classic E18 embryonal
hippocampal neurons culture system, just before axonal specifica-
tion [36]. ECM nanotopology also impacts on the motile behavior
of the cell with reduced motility being observed on the line
substrate, which also correlates with a low amount of filopodia on
the soma. The high degree of motility of neurons observed in
classic 2D environments might therefore be a result of the aberrant
filopodia formation on the cell soma in response to unrestricted
access to adhesion sites that might lead to excessive formation of
lamellipodia.
The finding that the sensing mechanism on the line pattern does
not require myosin-based contractility highlights different neuro-
nal guidance mechanisms depending on the dimensionality of the
laminin ECM. The previously described role of myosin contrac-
tility in neuronal guidance stems from experiments in which
growth cone turning is evaluated at borders of laminin and poly-
ornithine stripes. In such experiments, growth cone turning is
inhibited by pharmacological inhibition of myosin [37]. Most
likely on such stripes, which have micrometric size features,
growth cone filopodia experience the ECM as a 2D environment
and use myosin II-based mechanosensing to test rigidity of the
surrounding ECM. This might allow them to sense if they are
positioned on laminin or not. Interestingly, this mode of neuronal
guidance involves exploration of the substrate through neurite
extension and retraction cycles [21] as is observed with our cells on
the plain substrate. This is in marked contrast with our nanometric
line pattern, on which a myosin-independent, filopodia-mediated
stochastic search and capture mechanism allows orientation. This
allows orientation of neurite outgrowth coupled with steady
neurite outgrowth. In this mode of neuronal guidance, growth
cone filopodia most likely do not test rigidity by integrin-mediated
mechanosensing. Probably, they only measure the differential
extent of adhesion surface of aligned and non-aligned filopodia
and integrate it in a signaling response that allows the stabilization
of aligned filopodia.
To our knowledge, this is the first report that gives insight in
how neurons interpret topological cues in the ECM. A clear
advantage in our system is that the dynamics of the filopodia
mediated search and capture mechanism and of neurite outgrowth
are highly stereotypical. This should make it easy to quantify
phenotypes in response to perturbation experiments, and thus
provides a tractable model system to study neuronal guidance in
response to ECM topology. Using the N1E-115 neurite proteome
as a template [38], a combination of genetic perturbations and
high resolution live cell imaging methods is under investigation to
further explore the signaling events that allow to understand how
filopodia sense ECM topology and produce steady neurite
outgrowth.
Materials and Methods
Nanopattern fabrication
The PUA mold was composed of a functionalized prepolymer
with acrylate groups for crosslinking, a monomeric modulator, a
photoinitiator and a radiation-curable releasing agent for surface
activity. The liquid precursor was dropped onto a silicon master
that had been prepared by photolithography and a polyethylene
terephthalate film was placed on the liquid mixture. For the UV
curing, the mold was exposed to UV (l = 250–400 nm) light for 25
seconds and peeled off from the master. The 18-mm-diameter
glass cover slip was treated by oxygen plasma for 1 minute and
then coated with glass primer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30
seconds. After rinsing with isopropyl alcohol for 3 min, glass
coverslip was dried using N2 gas. For the nanopattern fabrication,
PUA liquid was dropped onto a prepared glass substrate and the
PUA mold was attached on the PUA droplet. The PUA droplet
Figure 6. Model of neurite guidance in response to nanotopographical cues.(A) Line substrate, unaligned growth cone. Filopodia scan the
line substrate through lateral scanning and protrusion/retraction events. Only few filopodia align on the lines and thus almost all filopodia senseonly
discrete adhesion points to the ECM. (B) Line substrate, aligned growth cone. Through stochastic sensing, multiple filopodia have aligned on the line
substrate and have assembled an F-actin rich cytoskeleton that stabilizes them. On the distal part of the growth cone, non-aligned, unstable filopodia
continue to operate, suggesting a crosstalk between both filopodia populations. This stabilizes the growth cone leading to steady neurite outgrowth.
(C) Plain substrate. Unrestricted access to ECM leads to a large amount of long filopodia, none of which can be stabilized by a robust F-actin
cytoskeleton. This is accompanied with a high frequency of neurite collapse events.

was cured by UV exposure for 25 seconds and the mold was
peeled off from the glass substrate.
Cell culture
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (American Tissue Culture Collec-
tion) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamin,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For differentiation, N1E-115 cells
were starved for 24 h in serum-free neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 1% Glutamin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cells were then detached with PUCK’s saline, and an adequate
number of cells were replated on coverslips (plain substrate) or
coverslips with the PUA pattern (line substrate). These coverslips
were previously coated with 10 ug/ml laminin for 2 h at 37uC. For
experiments with primary cells, cortical neurons were isolated.
Immunofluorescence, transfection and time-lapse
imaging
For immunofluorescence, cells were quickly washed in PBS,
fixed in BRB80 (80 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH
6.8) containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 30 seconds and
permeabilized in BRB containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25%
glutaraldehyde in BRB80 for 10 minutes. Coverslips were then
washed with PBS, incubated in freshly prepared 0.2% sodium
borohydride in PBS for 20 min, followed by two additional PBS
washes. Coverslips were then blocked in antibody solution (2%
BSA, 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 10 min. For staining, cells
were incubated with alexa-fluor 488 labeled phalloidin (Invitro-
gen), an antia-tubulin antibody (Sigma), an Alexa-fluor 546
conjugated secondary antibody, and DAPI for 30 min. After 3
PBS washes, cells were mounted on a coverslip using Prolong gold
(Invitrogen) as mounting medium. All microscopy was performed
using an Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon) steered by Metamorph
software (Molecular Devices) and using a LED-based light source
(Coolled). Low resolution images of neurons on coverslips, used to
measure neurite length were acquired using Nikon fluorescence
microscope using a 10x air objective. For neurite outgrowth
analysis, about 25 fields of view were automatically captured using
a motorized stage. Different measurements of fluorescence
intensities were performed using metamorph. High resolution
actin and tubulin images were acquired using an oil-immersion
60x high NA objective. For transfection, 36105 N1E-115 cells
were plated in one dish of a 6-well plate. The next day cells were
transfected with 2mg of plenti Lifeact-GFP using 4ml of FuGENE
transfection reagent (Roche) per well in presence of serum.
24 hours post-transfection cells were starved in neurobasal
medium, and 48 hours post-transfection cells were replated on
coverslips. For time-lapse imaging, 26104/well were replated in
12-well plate previously coated with 10 mg/ml laminin and
allowed to attach for three hours. The glass coverslip was
transferred to a Ludin Chamber (Life imaging services) and filled
with neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 mM Hepes.
Multi-stage time-lapse imaging was then performed.
Image and statistical analysis
All image analysis was performed using metamorph software
(Universal Imaging). For neurite outgrowth analysis (Fig. 1E),
average cell neurite length was measured on the multiple images
using the neurite outgrowth plugin. To measure F-actin intensities
in filopodia (Fig. 2E and 4C), mean fluorescence intensity of
a region of interest was computed and normalized to surface.
This was then further normalized to the lower F-actin intensities.
Cell alignment (Fig. 1D) and filopodium angle measurements
(Fig. 4C and E) were performed manually using the line scan tool.
Tracking of neurite tip (Fig. 3B) was performed manually using the
track points plugin. Statistical analysis was performed using two-
tailed t-test except for total neurite outgrowth analysis, for which
one-way ANOVA test was used to determine statistical differences
between plain and the line substrates with different spacings. A
value of p,0.05 is considered statistically significant.
