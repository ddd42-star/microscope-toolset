ABSTRACT 21 
 22 
Directed flows of cells in vivo are essential in morphogenesis. They shape living matter 23 
in phenomena involving cell mechanics and regulations of the acto-myosin 24 
cytoskeleton. However the onset of coherent motion is still poorly understood. Here we 25 
show that coherence is associated with spontaneous alignments of cell polarity by 26 
designing cellular rings of controlled dimensions. A tug- of-war between polarities 27 
dictates the onset of coherence, as assessed by tracking live cellular shapes and 28 
motions in various experimental conditions. In addition, we identify an internally driven 29 
constraint set by cellular acto-myosin cables at boundaries as essential to ensure 30 
coherence, and active force is generated as evaluated by the high RhoA activity. The 31 
cables are required to trigger coherence as shown by our numerical simulations based 32 
on a novel Vicsek-type model including free active boundaries. We quantitatively 33 
reproduce in silico  coherence onsets and we predict criteria leading to coherence. 34 
Altogether, spontaneous coherent motion results from basic competitions between cell 35 
orientations and active cables at boundaries.  36

INTRODUCTION 38 
 39 
Morphogenesis is driven by the interplay between Rho GTPases and the cytoskeleton 40 
1–4. In particular, the acto-myosin network drives morphogenesis at the cellular level by 41 
elongation or neighbor exchange 5,6, and the cross-talk between Rho signaling and 42 
cellular mechanics has emerged as a generic property of morphogenetic systems.  43 
Interestingly, these dynamics are often associated with directed motions of cells. 44 
Directional flows in epithelia are reported during development in a variety of systems 45 
ranging from Drosophila to zebrafish 7–9. For example, during the development of 46 
spherical mammary acini or during the egg chamber elongation in Drosophila, cells 47 
exhibit coherent rotation on large scales with speed up to 20µm.h -1 10–13. These 48 
motions are proposed to be important for the robust morphogenesis of embryos.   49

The collective motion of cells is difficult to understand based on a simple analysis of 1 
migrations at the single cell level. Individually, cells can move randomly or directionally. 2 
However the epithelial layers which connect cells through adherens junctions may or 3 
may not coordinate the motion of the group 14–16. The understanding of emergence of 4 
collective effects requires theoretical approaches in tight comparison with experiments. 5 
In addition, although the interplay between RhoA activity and the acto-myosin 6 
cytoskeleton is documented at the single cell level 1,17,18, it is not yet fully characterized 7 
at the multi-cellular scale. In this context of potential collective effects, the 8 
understanding of coherent motion requires to study cellular assembly in simple 9 
geometries in vitro compared quantitatively to numerical simulations.  10 
 11 
 12 
To this aim, we generated rings of epithelial cells, a geometry proposed by Turing in 13 
his 1952 article 19. This initial condition with boundaries is distinct from former work 20,21 14 
and led to the formation of rings of connected cells, a simple and reproducible periodic 15 
configuration with no confinement. This allows the characterization of the spontaneous 16 
evolution of the cellular ring. We varied the ring diameter to identify the inherent 17 
coherence length of our epithelial MDCK cells. We report that below a threshold 18 
perimeter, rings undergo spontaneous rotations. We next sought to extract the 19 
ingredients generating this coherence. We show that an internal tug-of-war between 20 
cell polarities within the ring determines the onset of coherence, as shown by the initial 21 
polarity distributions and the time required to reach coherence. Tracking of cell division 22 
as polarity breaker supports this framework. We also report that coherence is 23 
associated with two supracellular acto-myosin cables at the inner and outer boundaries 24 
of the monolayer: these continuous structures act as autonomous confinements as 25 
they exhibit high RhoA activity and are shown to prevent cells from spreading out and 26 
breaking coherence. Finally, we test in silico our central mechanism of polarity tug-of-27 
war coupled to the acto-myosin cables with a Vicsek-based model writing the 28 
fundamental laws of dynamics at cellular levels for polarity, velocity and including 29 
forces at boundaries. After calibration, we show that this computational approach 30 
predicts the dynamics of all rings with no ad hoc adjustments.  We also calculate phase 31 
diagrams for coherence as a function of cellular parameters combinations. Our results 32 
show that activity at boundaries – supported by RhoA activity in experiments – is 33 
indispensable to ensure cellular coherence. We propose that cell polarity tug- of-war 34 
together with self-generated confinement from spontaneously assembled active cables 35 
set the tempo for coherent movements in epithelial monolayers. 36

RESULTS 38

Obtaining coherent motion 40 
 41 
We first needed to identify the natural length over which cells migrate directionally – 42 
namely the maximal coherence length 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥– characterizing our system. A circular 43 
array of cells is expected to undergo rotation if the maximal coherence length 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 44 
matches the perimeter p. If the coherence length is smaller than the perimeter, non-45 
coherent motion is expected 21,22. To obtain 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥, we prepared multicellular rings with 46 
free boundaries and decreasing diameters by using micro-contact printing fibronectin 47 
regions and differential adhesion (see Methods) : 1000µm, 300µm and 180µm (see 48 
Movies S1 to S3, respectively), and we measured the 12-hours velocity fields (see 49 
Methods). Without confinement, cells could spread out on passivated and non-coated 50

regions, and rings had different behaviors: large rings – 1000µm – exhibited growth of 1 
cellular fingers inwards and outwards whereas smaller rings – 300µm and 180µm – 2 
behaved like cellular assemblies during wound healing with centripetal closure (see 3 
Fig.1a and Movies S1-S3). For 1000µm and 300µm rings, we saw local coherent flows 4 
of length 𝜉 (Fig. 1b) but no global coherence. However, at 180µm diameter, about a 5 
quarter of rings spontaneously rotated with a velocity of ~ 20µm.h -1, which suggested 6 
that we approached the perimeter value potentially leading to coherent motion. To find 7 
this perimeter, we plotted the correlation function of tangential velocity, and we  8 
extracted the maximal coherence length 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥(see Fig.1c, Fig.S1a and Methods) 23.  9 
We show that 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥, obtained from the x-intersect of the tangent at origin of the 10 
correlation function, is similar in every condition – 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 315µm (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a) 11 
–, demonstrating that  𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 is an inherent length of our cellular system.  12 
 13 
Based on this 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 of 315µm, we designed and focused on rings with 80µm diameter 14 
corresponding to 250µm perimeter below 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥. As expected, we “rectified” the motion 15 
of cells around the ring and we ended up with 83% of rings spontaneously rotating at 16 
a velocity of 20-25 µm.h -1 (see Movie S4, Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b). All results are then 17 
reported in Figure 1e, where 
𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑝  , the coherence length over the perimeter, is defined 18 
as an index of global coherence: it is equal to 1 when the whole ring rotates and gets 19 
close to 0 as the global coherence decreases. Interestingly, there is a bias in clockwise 20 
rotation which suggests a spontaneous cellular bias as reported in previous works 24,25 21 
(Fig. S1c).  22 
 23 
If coherence was obtained for this 80µm ring diameter, the time needed to reach this 24 
complete rotation (defined as 
𝜉
𝑝 = 1, see Materials and Methods) varied from 1 hour to 25 
10 hours and lasted from 1 hour to 10 hours (see Fig. S1d). This large distribution 26 
impeded quantification of the transition from non-coherent to coherent motions. 27 
Therefore, we needed to rescale the time needed to reach coherence starting from the 28 
initial condition of continuous ring of cells. We decided to align all plots with respect to 29 
the onset of coherence defined as 
𝜉
𝑝 = 1. We could then determine the quantitative 30 
behavior of coherence acquisition. This pseudo-time representation allowed to show 31 
that coherence acquisition is a process lasting about 1h30 with minor variability among 32 
rings (Fig. 1f). This timescale is fast considering the 12-hours duration of the 33 
experiment and this can be viewed as a quick switch between the two states. At 34 
coherence, a continuum of behaviours appeared among the rings populations from 35 
rings with persistent rotation over hours to rings with transient coherent motion shorter 36 
than one hour (Fig. 1f and Fig. S1d-e). To understand the origin of these dynamics, we 37 
measured next the ring velocity and persistence of rotation, and saw their correlations 38 
(Fig. S1f). This suggests that collective cell speed might be involved in maintaining 39 
coherence even though inertia is negligible at this scale.  40 
 41 
Tug-of-war between cell polarities sets coherence 42 
 43 
Next we sought to identify the cellular mechanism at play for the onset of coherent 44 
rotation. Cell polarity is a natural readout for its key role in setting direction of motion.  45 
We thus looked at the distribution of cell polarities inside rings. For this, we used 46 
labeled lamellipodia (see Fig. 2a, see Methods for the measurement of polarity). We 47 
observed selected lamellipodia orientation and direction. Initial polarities showed a bi-48

modal distribution peaked around tangential directions with two main orientations, i.e. 1 
0° and 180° (see Fig. 2b). These two states suggest that a tug- of-war between 2 
polarities could happen between cells of opposite directions within the same ring. We 3 
reasoned that initial polarities could then play a role in the time needed to reach 4 
coherent rotation. A large number of cells with the same polarities would minimize the 5 
tug-of-war, and would decrease the time to coherence. We then followed each cell 6 
polarity defined by tight-junction organisation (see Fig. 2c and Movie S5). We had 7 
checked that the direction of shape anisotropy defined by cell geometry correlates with 8 
the direction of the lamellipodia (Fig. S2Aa-b). Our measurements of percentage of 9 
cells with aligned polarities as a function of time to coherence show a decreasing 10 
relationship (Fig. 2d). This further indicates that distribution of single cell polarities 11 
imposes a tug-of-war and determines the time needed to enter coherence. We tested 12 
this statement by inhibiting lamellipodia formation with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 and 13 
this prevented coherence (Fig. S2B) by suppressing the tug-of-war between polarities. 14 
 15 
The co-existence of opposite polarities is expected to generate stretching within the 16 
ring. From tight junctions contours, we could also extract cell elongation (Fig. 2c and 17 
Fig. S2A). Using the pseudo-time as the reference (Fig. 2e), we report  three phases: 18 
(i) 2.5 hours before coherence, cells elongate until (ii) their tangential stretch reach 19 
constant values sustained for about 1 hour; (iii) coherence starts shortly within 1h 20 
followed by a rapid drop in elongation (see Fig. S2). This is distinct from non coherent 21 
rings (see Fig. S2Ac). These measurements substantiate our framework: cell 22 
lamellipodia “pull” in opposite directions leading to cellular stretch and resolution of this 23 
competition induces cell stretch relaxation visualized by the rapid drop in stretch.  24 
 25 
Cell divisions as polarity breakers impede coherence  26 
 27 
To further test the central role for polarity in setting coherence, we tracked cell division 28 
events within rings. Right after mitosis, cells have opposite polarities and thus are 29 
expected to challenge polarity alignments. These opposite polarities indeed happened 30 
at cell division within rings (see Figure 2f). We quantified the effect by plotting the 31 
cumulative number of cell divisions within rings. We saw that rings where division 32 
regularly occurred were related to poorly coherent motion (Fig. 2g, bottom). In contrast, 33 
when a burst of many cell divisions occurred within a short time period (typically 2 34 
hours over a total time of experiment of 12 hours), coherence was maintained in its 35 
optimal value (Fig. 2g, top). Divisions generate cells with opposite polarities and 36 
impede coherence (see Fig. S2Ae,g,h). Division as a polarity breaker acts as a 37 
coherence breaker. 38 
 39 
 40 
Acto-myosin cables as internally self-assembled boundaries imposing 41 
tangential cell polarity  42 
 43 
So far, we reported that cells were polarized within the ring and we next sought to 44 
further understand why tangential orientation was selected (Fig. 2a-b). If the rings were 45 
confined by physical walls, this orientation would be favored20. However, in our assay, 46 
cells were free to move in any directions suggesting that an additional phenomenon 47 
biases cell polarities. We first stained for actin and myosin since acto-myosin cables 48 
were reported to self-assemble within cells at epithelial colony boundaries 17,26,27 (Fig. 49 
S3Aa). This generic feature was therefore expected to appear as well in our rings and 50

we hypothesized that these structures could contribute to orient cell polarity. We show 1 
in Figure 3a the presence of these acto-myosin cables and we propose that cells 2 
internally set their “walls” which in turn could potentially make them be oriented along  3 
the perimeter rather than radially.   4 
 5 
To test this idea, we evaluated the mechanical contributions of these cables and their 6 
roles in cell confinement. First with live observations, we saw that the inner cable was 7 
contractile and led first to the closure of rings within hours prior to extension ‘out’ of the 8 
cellular disk now formed (Fig. 3b, Fig. S3Ab and Movies S3-4). This suggests that 9 
indeed inner cable pulls inwards as expected for a contracting acto-myosin cable. This 10 
dynamic was distinct from larger rings of 1mm (see Fig. 1 and Movie S1) which 11 
suggests that cable curvature plays a role in cell motion 28. This curvature dependence 12 
was further substantiated by experiments with elliptical geometries (see Fig. S3B) . 13 
Then, we reasoned that the outer ring may act the same way by pushing cells inwards. 14 
To evaluate whether these structures were contractile, we used laser ablation 15 
experiments 29. First we observed a fast and large opening of both cables within 16 
seconds with a similar extent of ~ 12µm (see Figure 3c and 3d and Movie S6, see also 17 
Fig. SA3b, and Methods). This demonstrates that cables are more tensile than cell-cell 18 
junctions also tested in these experiments which yielded small openings (~ 1µm). In 19 
addition, we measured the opening velocity after laser ablation as a read-out for 20 
comparing stress between inner and outer cables assuming they bear the same 21 
damping coefficients 29. Our results suggest that acto-myosin cables indeed apply 22 
contractile constraints on the boundary cells and with similar values (see Fig. 3d). 23 
 24 
Next, we tested the impact of this contraction at boundaries on cell polarity. We 25 
followed cells transfected with Lifeact within non labeled rings. We report in Fig. 3e and 26 
Movie S7 the interplay between cell polarity and the outer acto-myosin cable: cells 27 
could build their own acto-myosin cables while the structure imposes lamellipodia to 28 
be oriented tangentially. This supports the notion that acto-myosin cables and 29 
tangential polarity are correlated. 30 
 31 
To further test this coupling, we sought to remove locally the influence of acto-myosin 32 
cables. We included within rings single cells expressing caldesmon (CaD) (Fig. 3f), a 33 
calmodulin binding protein inhibiting Myosin ATPase 30. Indeed this triggered a local 34 
decrease in myosin activity and in cable contractility. These caldesmon expressing 35 
cells extended out of the rings with a radial motion (Movie S8). This further confirms 36 
the key role played by the cables in confining cell polarity tangentially. This perturbation 37 
also impaired rotations in the majority of cases (see Fig. 3g and Suppl. Fig. 3d). On 38 
average, we found that coherence was lower on CaD mosaic rings (Fig. 3g) and this 39 
was correlated to the amount of CaD levels (Fig. S3Ae). Altogether, this suggests that 40 
continuity of the acto-myosin rings is important for tangential motion and coherence. In 41 
conclusion, cables are essential to confine and orient cells polarities tangentially and 42 
further trigger rotations.  43 
 44 
Force is active at boundaries and cell velocity is corelated with RhoA level.  45 
 46 
Observations and measurements on cell dynamics could hide signaling effects 47 
associated to regulations of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton by the small GTPase 48 
RhoA31,32. To evaluate this potential contribution, we analysed the correlation between 49 
spatio-temporal dynamics of RhoA activity and cell dynamics. For this, we used a 50

FRET sensor which shows distributions of active RhoA in space and time (Fig. 4a and 1 
Ref.18,33, see Methods and Fig. S4a-c). In MDCK rings, we found the largest activity at 2 
inner and outer boundaries, where acto-myosin cables are assembled (Movie S9, Fig. 3 
4b and Fig. 3a). This supports the contractile nature of these fibers. Accordingly, we 4 
found that the closure time of rings is shorter for large FRET activities in cables (see 5 
Fig. S4d-e). We can conclude that regulation by RhoA mediates active forces at 6 
boundaries.  7 
 8 
Building on this result, we sought to test whether correlation between RhoA and cell 9 
velocity could be at play in the onset of coherence, knowing that cell velocity plays a 10 
key role in collective cell motion. We analyzed locally and globally velocity fields and 11 
their associated FRET maps (Fig. 4c and Fig. S4h, f, g, see also Methods). We found 12 
that high velocity regions for cells were correlated with low FRET levels (Fig. 4d,e and 13 
Suppl Mat). This suggests an inverse relationship between the two quantities (see also 14 
Fig S4i). Cells move faster with lower levels of FRET. This further supports the notion 15 
that RhoA activity is essentially encoded in cell velocity.  16 
 17 
We then turned to numerical simulations to check whether the onset of collective 18 
motions could happen with basic interactions rules extrapolated from our experimental 19 
results, i.e. active force at boundaries and cell velocity rule. 20 
 21 
   22 
Numerical simulations reproduce the ring dynamics qualitatively and 23 
quantitatively 24 
 25 
We designed numerical simulations based on an original Vicsek type model with active 26 
boundaries, involving parameters accessible to experiments (see Fig. 5, Fig. S5, Table 27 
1 and Annex_Math). Cells are represented as particles with velocity v and  polarity p. 28 
Backed up by experimental observations (Fig. S5a-b), we assume that cell velocity 29 
aligns to its polarity. Cell polarity is allowed to diffuse with a coefficient D (Fig. S5d-e) 30 
and aligns with the average polarity around the ring with rate μ (Fig. S5f). Cell polarity 31 
is also assumed to align with cell velocity direction with rate . Local springs between 32 
boundary cells dynamically describe the inner and outer cables. Active and passive 33 
contributions of these cables are incorporated in the polarity dynamics. Table 1 34 
summarizes data taken from experiments and inserted as an input to the model. More 35 
details are provided in Annex Math. 36 
 37 
We report in Fig. 5 the comparisons in shapes and coherence values across 38 
conditions. The ring phenotypes are reproduced with multicellular fingers or clusters 39 
for distinct colony diameters (Fig. 5a and Movie S10-13). Similarly, the coherence 40 
index is quantitatively obtained with excellent precision (see Fig. 5b) together with its 41 
typical time dependence (Fig. 5c). Also, the tug- of-war between polarities correlated 42 
with the time required to reach coherence for simulated rings with quantitative 43 
consistency with experimental times (Fig. 5d). We also found that closure time depends 44 
on the initial cell alignment (Fig. S6a). 45 
 46 
In addition, we could probe numerically the potential contribution of active forces at 47 
cables: in our model, cables have a passive component corresponding to the stretching 48 
and bending moduli of the acto-myosin structure, and an active component translating 49 
the contribution of cables in setting tangential polarities (as explained above and 50

shown in Figure 3). Interestingly, the active component was required for the onset of 1 
coherence (Fig. 5e). We also tested the effect of having a cell with no cable within the 2 
ring, thereby modelling the caldesmon experiment (Fig. 3f): the phenotype of this cell 3 
escape was reproduced as well (Fig. 5f and Movie S14), substantiating the 4 
confinement role of cables. We checked that extremely stiff cable acted as walls like 5 
in Jain et al. and led to coherent motion (Fig. A10 and A11, Annex Math). 6 
 7 
Finally, we generated phase diagrams to understand the relationship between 8 
coherence and cell polarity and cables activity. We found the range of values 9 
necessary to trigger coherence for the main parameters of the model (cell polarity 10 
alignment, cable activity and physical properties) (Fig. 5g and 5h). We show that the 11 
coherence value is essentially governed by the cell polarity alignment: a large collective 12 
alignment increases coherence (Fig.  5g and Fig. S6c-d) while the bending and the 13 
stretching moduli (passive terms) do not affect coherence initiation at least in the range 14 
of considered parameters (Fig. 5h and Fig. S6b). However, the cables properties have 15 
a strong impact on the closure time of the ring and passive and active terms have 16 
antagonist effects in this regard (Fig. S5g and S5h).  17 
 18 
Altogether our numerical experiments based on measured cellular parameters and 19 
with basic interactions for single cells show that we can capture the main features for 20 
the onset of coherence with no need to incorporate parameters other than polarity and 21 
active cables at boundaries.  22 
 23 
DISCUSSION 24 
 25 
We show that coherence of cellular movements emerges when the system size is 26 
below the coherence length inherent to MDCK cells as reported previously on epithelial 27 
disks 21,22,34,35. Cells align their polarities within the ring and this step sets the onset of 28 
coherence. Furthermore, acto -myosin cables act as internally driven constrains 29 
confining cells tangentially. RhoA activity is larger at boundaries co -localizing with 30 
cables and is inversely related to the cell maxim um velocity. Finally, with these 31 
ingredients, experimental and numerical rings share qualitative and quantitative 32 
features, supporting the relevance of our minimal framework for cell interactions. We 33 
show that active forces at cables are critical to orient  cell polarity and contribute to 34 
coherence. 35 
 36 
Internally driven coherence versus externally driven coherence  37 
 38 
Emergence of coherent flows has been studied in vitro in confined situations 20–22. Cells 39 
were chemically or mechanically confined and cannot escape their adhesive patterns 40 
21,22. This led to distinct phenomena – although with similar velocities of 20 µm.h -1 - 41 
where the coherence is not driven only by the cellular characteristics but also by the 42 
boundaries of confinement as suggested by previous theoretical works 36. In Ref. 20, 43 
this led to rotations even on rings with a diameter of 1mm, far above the natural 44 
coherence length of the epithelial cell line. We reproduced this result numerically (see 45 
Sec. 3.4 Annex Math) which further shows that the external walls may impose the 46 
rotation for large scales. Intuitively this can be understood by the fact that cell motion 47 
within a cohesive ring monolayer can only be tangential with solid boundary.  In our 48 
case, we let cells spontaneously self-organize without confinement and we decreased 49 
the pattern size to initiate the onset of coherence. This new configuration makes this 50

rotation spontaneous in essence and not guided by 3D walls which force the motion 1 
along the ring. Remarkably, the symmetry of rotation clockwise-counterclockwise is 2 
broken on average, in contrast to former studies in confinement 20 but in agreement 3 
with the bias reported in other studies24,25,37 with potential roles for left-right asymmetry 4 
during development. We make the hypothesis that chirality at the single cell level – 5 
generated by molecular structures with broken symmetry 25 – is conserved through 6 
scales and is translated in the emerging collective motion 38. Altogether, our 7 
spontaneous broken symmetry reveals inherent cellular properties which convey 8 
spatio-temporal order selected by cells.  9 
 10 
Coherence length and spatial scales 11 
 12 
It is interesting to analyze the potential origin of this natural coherence length. This 13 
length is distinct from former works reporting spontaneous flows of active nematics : 14 
rotation was not associated with opposite senses of rotation at boundaries, and the 15 
coherence length is higher compared to these 2D confluent monolayers. Here, cell 16 
motions are not impeded by cellular jamming seen in fully confluent monolayers 39. 17 
Therefore, we propose that the coherence length found in our study is not expected to 18 
be the same as that defining the crossover from rotation to active turbulence seen in 19 
fully two dimensional confluent layers of cells.  20 
 21 
In addition, the passage from single cell to tens of cells forming a new entity necessarily 22 
go through adhesion mediated by cell-cell junctions and its interplay with cytoskeleton. 23 
We indeed saw that rings with MDCK cells overexpressing cadherins presented a 24 
larger amount of rotations compared to WT MDCK cells. This suggests that larger 25 
adherence between cells either increases the coherence length or/and initiation is 26 
facilitated due to higher cell polarization rates µ and nu. Therefore, we can conjecture 27 
that the spontaneous length could be organ dependent and contribute to the key 28 
morphogenesis events. 29 
 30 
RhoA activity and its inverse relation with velocity 31 
 32 
We report live activity of RhoA integrated over an entire multicellular system. With 33 
coarse graining, we considered MDCK rings as a continuum material where RhoA has 34 
its own dynamics and extracted FRET levels through time and space. Our results point 35 
to a simplification in their connection : RhoA and velocity are inversely related (along 36 
other work 40) and this allows to consider only velocities for the model. This 37 
simplification would need to be further tested in other situations but it opens an 38 
interesting framework with a simple relation between RhoA activity and cell velocity. In 39 
future studies, RhoA and other Rho GTPases could be modulated through space and 40 
time using photoactivable tools to further understand its implication in  collective 41 
coherent motion41,42. This will allow to control cell polarity and cell velocity and in turn 42 
characterize the coupling between Rho signaling and cell mechanics in specific 43 
manner with identification of new mechanosensory proteins. 44 
 45 
Implication of coherent motions in vivo 46 
 47 
Our velocities found during coherent motion were close to the ones found during 48 
Drosophila egg chamber development 10,11. In this context, follicle cells collectively 49 
rotate along the chamber and the presence of lamellipodia is reported 10. This could 50

potentially mean that the phenomena described in this work on 2D rings, driven by cell 1 
“cryptic” lamellipodia, act also during these in vivo processes. Also, coherent rotations 2 
have been reported in various morphogenetic events in vivo in mammary acini, in egg 3 
chamber and in testis rotation in Drosophila 10–13,43. We propose that these phenomena 4 
could be generic and experienced by any growing tissues as suggested also by a 5 
recent theoretical study 44. If right, spontaneous rotation could occur when coherence 6 
lengths of each epithelial layer would be similar to dimensions of tissues. It would be 7 
interesting to compare coherence lengths across model systems to evaluate whether 8 
this generic property of living matter is physiological and is important for optimal 9 
development.  10

MATERIAL AND METHODS 1 
 2 
Micro-contact printing 3 
 4 
Ring motifs are patterned on glass coverslips using micro-contact printing. 5 
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; 1:10 w/w cross-linker:pre-polymer) (Sylgard 184 kit, 6 
Dow Corning, cat. DC184-1.1). Stamps are produced with UV-photolithography. 7 
Stamps are rinsed with 70% ethanol and then rendered hydrophilic by exposure to 8 
oxygen plasma (30s) (Diener Electronic, cat. ZeptoB). They are next incubated with a 9 
10 µg/mL rhodamine-labelled fibronectin solution (Cytoskeleton, cat. FNR01-A) for 1h 10 
and then dried at room temperature for about 5min. In the meantime, glass coverslips 11 
are functionalized by vapour phase for 1h with 3-(mercapto)propyltrimethoxysilane 12 
(FluroChem). After incubation of both the coverslip and PDMS, the stamp is deposited 13 
onto the glass slide and kept in contact during 30min. To ensure a proper transfer 14 
between the two surfaces, a 50g weight is placed on the top of the stamp. Finally, the 15 
stamp is removed and the printed coverslip is washed with PBS 1X and stored in Milli-16 
Q water. Non-printed areas are passivated with 0.1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG (in 1mM 17 
HEPES pH 7.4, SuSoS AG, cat. SZ33-15) for 20min at room temperature. This 18 
approach consists in setting differential coating on the surface allowing to plate cells 19 
and select cells adhering to the fibronectin printed ring. 20 
 21 
Cell Culture 22 
 23 
MDCK cells stably transfected with E-cadherin-DsRED are cultured in low glucose 24 
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s (DMEM) with 10% F oetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% 25 
Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cells are kept subconfluent (at ~ 70%). Prior experiments, 26 
cells are detached with Trypsin-0.25% EDTA (Fisher Scientific, cat. 11570626) and 27 
centrifuged at 500rpm during 3min. The pellet is then re-suspended in DMEM 1% FBS. 28 
This low serum concentration will further impede attachment on the passivated surface 29 
during the first hours following seeding (differential adhesion). After 1h incubation, the 30 
printed surface is carefully washed out to remove cells from the non-printed area. After 31 
washout, DMEM is replaced by L-15 Leibovitz Medium (Fisher Scientific, cat. 32 
11540556) supplemented with 1% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin and the 33 
sample is incubated 1h under the microscope at 37°C before acquisition. This last 34 
incubation allows cells to spread on patterns and ensures that rings are closed at the 35 
onset of the experiment.  36 
 37 
For laser ablation experiments, MDCK stably transfected with GFP-Myosin Regulatory 38 
Light Chain (MRLC) were used. Tight junctions were imaged with a MDCK cell line 39 
genetically engineered with CRISPR-Cas9 to express ZO1-GFP 45. We generated a 40 
MDCK cell line stably expressing the RhoA FRET biosensor using Piggy-Bac 41 
engineering. Briefly, cells were transfected with the biosensor plasmid together with a 42 
transposase. After integration into the genome, fluorescent cells were sorted with flow 43 
cytometry and kept under antibiotics pressure for 3 weeks.  44 
 45 
Transfection 46 
 47 
Plasmids for mosaic experiments such as Actin-GFP or Caldesmon-GFP were 48 
incubated with cells using Lipofectamin (Invitrogen, cat. 11668030). One day prior 49 
experiment, cells at 50% confluency in a 6-well plate were incubated for 4-6h with 1µg 50

of DNA and 10µL of lipofectamin mixed in Opti-MEM medium. After incubation, wells 1 
are washed out and the medium is replaced by fresh DMEM 10% FBS.  2 
 3 
Drug experiments 4 
 5 
Cells were incubated with CK666 50µM (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. SML0006) during the 6 
whole course of the experiment (12 hours).  7 
For RhoA inhibition, cells were incubated 2 hours with C3-transferase (Cytoskeleton 8 
Inc., cat. CT03-A) at a concentration of 1µg/mL. Culture medium was washed out 9 
before the start of the experiment. 10 
 11 
Standard time-lapse microscopy 12 
 13 
Phase contrast images were acquired through a 10x objective (NA = 0.25) with a frame 14 
rate of 1 image every 10min. Patterns were systematically checked prior the time-lapse 15 
start with a standard epifluorescence lamp (FluoArc Hg Lamp) coupled with a 16 
rhodamine fluorescence filter. The very same set-up was used to acquire cells during 17 
mosaic experiments (actin-GFP and caldesmon-GFP). Tight junctions (ZO1-GFP) 18 
were imaged with a confocal microscope (Leica SP8 inverted) and an autofocus 19 
system. All z-planes were taken and finally projected onto one single plane.  20 
 21 
Biosensor FRET activity 22 
 23 
Images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Leica SP8 inverted) with the 24 
pinhole opened to the maximum in order to increase slice thickness and the signal to 25 
noise ratio for the analysis. We used two Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) as detectors. 26 
Bandwidths were chosen as follow: 472nm-512nm for mTFP1 (CFP analog, donor) 27 
and 523nm-544nm for Venus (YFP analog, acceptor). mTFP1 was excited by an argon 28 
laser at 468nm with 15% of power and emission for mTFP1 (donor) and Venus (FRET) 29 
were simultaneously acquired by the two PMTs. Images were then corrected and 30 
processed with Biosensor Package from Danuser Lab (available on the following link: 31 
https://github.com/DanuserLab/Biosensor). Because it is a unimolecular biosensor, no 32 
bleedthrough correction was done. Prior analysis, histograms were manually resliced 33 
in order to remove high and close-to-zero boundary artefacts.  34 
 35 
To check whether the FRET sensor was reliable, we performed additional tests: 36 
incubation with 1.0 µg/ml C3-transferase (RhoA inhibitor, Cytoskeleton, cat. CT04) and 37 
with 1.0 µg/ml of RhoA activator (Cytoskeleton, cat. CN03). Drugs led to decrease and 38 
increase of activities respectively (Fig. S4a-b). We also used a mutant sensor – F39A, 39 
unable to interact with the RBD domain 18 – with the same acquisition parameters 40 
detailed above. This was associated with a significant decrease in the FRET signal 41 
(Fig. S4c). 42 
 43 
Laser ablation 44 
 45 
Laser ablations on acto-myosin cables were done using the FRAP module from a Leica 46 
SP-5 inverted microscope. The sample was imaged and ablated through a 40x oil 47 
objective (NA = 1.25) and an 800nm infrared laser (80 MHz, pulsed). 48

 1 
Velocity fields and coherence length 2 
 3 
Velocity fields were generated using PIVlab 1.4 and performing cross-correlations. 4 
Windows of about a cell size, adjusted to the magnification (32x32 or 64x64 in PIVlab) 5 
were taken. No smoothing was performed on the velocity fields.  6 
Coherence lengths 𝜉 were extracted from velocity fields with a custom-made Matlab 7 
code by computing the spatial correlation function of the tangential velocity 𝑣𝜃:  8 
 9 
𝐶𝑣𝜃(𝛿𝑥,𝑡) =
⟨𝑣𝜃⃗⃗⃗⃗ (𝑥  + 𝛿𝑥  ,𝑡).𝑣𝜃⃗⃗⃗⃗ (𝑥  ,𝑡)⟩
⟨𝑣𝜃(𝑥  ,𝑡)²⟩  10 
 11 
Exponential decays are generated from the computations of 𝐶𝑣𝜃 and the intersections 12 
between the tangents at origin and x -axis give 𝜉. Because 𝐶𝑣𝜃 was not always 13 
converging to 0, we made linear fits on the 3 first points of 𝐶𝑣𝜃 in order to extract the 14 
tangent at origin.  15 
 16 
We selected 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 to capture the largest length accessible to the cells. To extract this 17 
maximal coherence length 𝜉𝑚𝑎𝑥 presented in Figure 1c and Fig. S1a, velocity fields 18 
were averaged over intervals of 10 frames (100min) and the time interval leading to 19 
the largest correlation function was considered. Stated differently, we isolated the time 20 
window during which the coherent motion was optimal and extracted the associated 21 
length over experimental conditions. 22 
 23 
Image processing 24 
 25 
Nuclei in RhoA ratiometric maps were removed using Ilastik and phase contrast 26 
images were processed with Fiji.  27 
 28 
Cell polarity was defined by its lamellipodium: the axis nucleus-lamellipodium sets 29 
direction and orientation for cell polarity. Since many factors could contribute to define 30 
physical polarity and because lamellipodia are not always observable, we decided to 31 
track ZO1 marked cells – not in their anisotropy of signal – but for the well-defined 32 
shapes. In majority of cases, cells could be associated to isocele triangles. Therefore, 33 
cell polarity was given by the long axis of the triangle while the sense was defined by 34 
the triangle base. We confirmed that this polarity was consistent with the polarity 35 
defined by lamellipodia in the large majority of cases (Fig. S2a-b). Segmentation and 36 
extraction of single cell parameters in ZO1 experiments were done using Tissue 37 
Analyzer 46 in Fiji.  38

Model 40 
 41 
We designed a mechanistic- based minimal “Vicsek— type model” in which cells are 42 
treated as particles with polarity p and velocity v, initially placed on a ring with two 43 
layers of cells matching the cell density and number tested in experiments. Their 44 
interaction rules are determined by alignment of polarities and by polarity relaxation to 45 
the direction of motion and by random fluctuations of polarities (see Annex Math for 46 
details). Velocities are also projected on the directions of polarities to the limit of volume 47 
exclusion. The inner and outer supra-cellular acto-myosin cables are modeled as 48

segments connecting boundary cells with two physical elastic properties, stretching 1 
and bending energies. In addition to the force exerted by the cables on the cells and 2 
its velocities, cables also act on cell polarity. The values of parameters are extracted 3 
from measurements and from estimates based on references (see Annex Math and 4 
Table 1).  5

We show (see Fig. 5e) that with this passive treatment of cables and actual 7 
experimental values, we do not recapitulate coherent motion. Based on the Rho activity 8 
at both cables supporting an active stress generation, we add in the model an active 9 
cable force with estimates of the associated experimental values.  Simulations based 10 
on the theoretical model reveal that cells undergo coherent motion for small rings. 11 
Moreover, when we increase the ring diameter keeping the same values for 12 
parameters, we reproduce the experimental dynamics with no further adjustments. 13 
These results support the relevance of our model.  14

is similar to simulated rings. (e) Coherence index for two different populations of MDCK 12 
rings: activity within cable facilitates acquisition of coherence. (f) Caldesmon 13
