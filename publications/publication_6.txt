Mechanical interactions between cells play a fundamental role in the 
self-organization of organisms. How these interactions drive coordinated 
cell movement in three dimensions remains unclear. Here we report 
that cell doublets embedded in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix 
undergo spontaneous rotations. We investigate the rotation mechanism 
and find that it is driven by a polarized distribution of myosin within cell 
cortices. The mismatched orientation of this polarized distribution breaks 
the doublet mirror symmetry. In addition, cells adhere at their interface 
through adherens junctions and with the extracellular matrix through focal 
contacts near myosin clusters. We use a physical theory describing the 
doublet as two interacting active surfaces to show that rotation is driven by 
myosin-generated gradients of active tension whose profiles are dictated 
by interacting cell polarity axes. We also show that three-dimensional shape 
symmetries are related to broken symmetries of the myosin distribution in 
cortices. T o test for the rotation mechanism, we suppress myosin clusters 
using laser ablation and generate new myosin clusters by optogenetics. 
Our work clarifies how polarity-oriented active mechanical forces drive 
collective cell motion in three dimensions.
Spontaneous cell rotational motions have been reported in a variety of 
contexts in vivo. For instance, tissues undergo rotation during develop-
ment in Drosophila in the egg chamber1, in the ommatidia of the retina2, 
in the genitalia3 and in zebrafish embryos, where rotation of cell pairs 
occurs in the zebrafish’s lateral line4. In early Caenorhabditis elegans 
embryo development, chiral counter-rotating flows break chiral sym-
metry and play a role in setting the organism’s left–right axis5,6.
Seminal observations in vitro in two dimensions have shown that 
endothelial adhering cells migrating on a substrate and confined within 
a two-dimensional pattern form a stably rotating doublet7. The cell–cell 
interface adopts a curved shape, such that the doublet acquires an 
overall shape reminiscent of a ‘yin–yang’ symbol. More recently, groups 
of epithelial cells were reported to undergo rotation within rings8,9. In 
three dimensions in vitro, during alveologenesis of human mammary 
gland organoids, it has been shown that branches also undergo rota-
tion10. In addition, Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells can assem-
ble into hollow cysts in three dimensions, which undergo spontaneous 
rotation in an assay within two layers of Matrigel11. There, the two layers 
of Matrigel impose a polarization axis to the cyst, which allows one to 
probe for chiral broken symmetry, revealed in a bias in the direction of

rotation vector further indicated a characteristic correlation time 
of a few hours (Fig. 1i).
Dynamics of doublet elongation during rotation
We then wondered whether doublet cells were rotating relative to each 
other or were rotating together as a solid object (Fig. 2a). We reasoned 
that, in the latter case, the doublet elongation axis would rotate together 
with the rotation vector ω. We extracted from computationally seg-
mented doublet shapes (Fig. 1d) the three orthogonal principal axes 
of elongation and evaluated the corresponding relative elongation 
magnitudes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Section 3). We noted that the 
elongation of the doublet major axis was maximal at cell division and 
then relaxed to a nearly constant value, following the same trend as the 
magnitude of rotation, but in reverse (Figs. 1h and 2b). We then tested 
whether the rotation axis was correlated with the axis of maximal doublet 
elongation. This revealed a strong anti-correlation between the major 
axis of elongation and the direction of rotation (Fig. 2c), indicating that 
the elongation major axis is within the plane of rotation. The two minor 
cell elongation axes had, instead, weak positive correlations to the axis 
of rotation. The elongation major axis was also aligned with the vector 
joining the centre of mass of the cells, indicating that it rotates together 
with the doublet (Fig. 2c). Overall, these results suggest that the doublet 
rotates as a single physical object. Consistent with this idea, patterns  
of E-cadherin (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Section 7 and  
Supplementary Video 5) and actin (Supplementary Video 6) at the cell–
cell contact remained similar during ~ 1 h 30 min of observation.
Mode decomposition of interface deformation
We then quantified the shape of the interface between the two cells of 
the doublet (Fig. 2d). We found that the area of the interface reached 
a steady-state value and then remained constant for more than 7 h 
(Extended Data Fig. 4c). The average deviation of the interface from 
a planar shape was increasing with the magnitude of the doublet 
rotation (Fig. 2e,f ). Cross-sections of the doublet showed that the 
interface was curved in a way that evoked a yin–yang shape, as noticed 
previously for doublets rotating on a substrate7 (Fig. 1b–d). However, 
when looking at the full interface three-dimensional shape, we noticed 
that the shape was more complex than suggested by this simple pic-
ture (Fig. 2e). T o make sense of this complex shape, we decomposed 
it into basic modes of deformations, which we obtained from Zernike 
polynomials and classified according to their symmetry properties 
(Fig. 2d and Supplementary Section 4). We defined a ‘bowl’ mode 
corresponding to a rotationally symmetric deviation of the interface, 
a ‘saddle-node’ mode with the symmetry properties of a nematic, a 
‘three-fold’ mode with a three-fold rotation symmetry and a ‘yin–yang’ 
shape with a positive and a negative peak of deformation and the 
symmetry property of a vector (Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supple -
mentary Section 4.2). We then measured the average magnitude of 
these four deformation modes (Fig. 2g). We found that all four modes 
contributed to the interface shape, while the saddle-node mode was 
dominant in relative magnitude (Fig. 2g). We then tested whether the 
orientations of the shape deformation modes were correlated with the 
axis of rotation (Fig. 2h). We calculated correlation values considering 
rotation. Altogether, rotational flow appears to be a common feature 
of the collective motion of interacting cells.
However, it is unclear how these rotational movements arise 
from the distribution of force-generating elements in the cell. Several 
models have been proposed to explain the rotation of a cell doublet 
on a two-dimensional substrate confined in a micropattern, using 
phase-field, particle-based or cellular Potts models 12–17. These mod-
els exhibit simultaneous doublet rotation and/or interface defor -
mation, based on a representation of actin polymerization forces 
and protrusion-forming forces12–17, coupling to a biochemical system 
exhibiting spontaneous polarization through feedback between an 
activator and inhibitor13 or to an internal polarization field14,15. Despite 
these advances, it is still unclear what biophysical mechanisms under-
lie collective cell rotation in three dimensions and, notably, how 
force-generating elements in the cell self-organize to drive coherent 
cell motion.
Dynamics of MDCK doublet rotation
In this Article, we describe the exploitation of a novel assay to study the 
mechanism behind the spontaneous rotation in three dimensions of 
MDCK cell doublets. We confined cells within a thin layer of Matrigel, 
close to the coverslip, to optimize imaging resolution (Fig. 1a and Meth-
ods). Strikingly, all embedded MDCK cell clusters undergo spontaneous 
rotation. We focus here on adhering cell doublets that emerge from 
the division of a single cell. There was no obvious common orientation 
of the axis of rotation of cell doublets, and in most but not all cases, a 
lumen at the cell–cell interface rotated with the doublet (Fig. 1b and 
Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Single cells, instead, did not rotate in 
Matrigel (Extended Data Fig. 1). Cells participating in the rotating dou-
blet, however, do not have to be sister cells, as two cells with different 
fluorescent E-cadherin labels could adhere to each other and initiate 
rotation (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Video 3). Doublet rotation was 
preserved following E-cadherin knockout (KO) (Extended Data Fig. 2 
and Supplementary Video 4), suggesting also that E-cadherin-mediated 
adhesion was accompanied by other adherens junctions between cells 
presenting this doublet rotation18.
T o investigate quantitatively doublet rotation (Supplementary 
Sections 1 and 2), we imaged rotating doublets expressing E-cadherin 
and computationally segmented cell shapes in the doublet (Fig. 1d, 
Supplementary Video 5 and Methods). We calculated the centre of 
mass and velocity of each doublet cell, which allows the definition 
of a doublet rotation vector ω  (Fig. 1e). The norm of the rotation 
vector increased after cell division for ~100 min, before reaching 
a roughly constant rotational velocity of ~180° h −1 for a duration 
of ~10 h, corresponding to about five continuous full turns along 
the same direction (Fig. 1f,g). This is consistent with previously 
reported rotation velocities of MDCK cysts and breast epithelial cell 
spheres 11,19. Plotting the trajectory of the vector ω showed that the 
axis of rotation is not fixed but appears to drift over time (Fig. 1h and 
Extended Data Fig. 3). This is expected to the extent that no external 
cue sets a preferred axis of rotation. We note that this also implies 
that the spinning motion of the doublet does not intrinsically break 
chiral symmetry. Plotting the correlation function of the normalised

the symmetry properties of each mode of deformation. Only the 
yin–yang mode, but neither the saddle-node nor three-fold mode, 
had an orientation correlated with the direction of rotation (Fig. 2h). 
Altogether, the doublet interface has a complex three-dimensional 
shape, and one mode of interface deformation correlated with the 
doublet rotation.
Cortical myosin distribution encoded in cell 
polarity
Having characterized the doublet rotation and the doublet interface 
shape, we then asked whether key proteins of the cytoskeleton and 
adhesion machinery had a distribution correlated with the doublet rota-
tion. We stained cell doublets for phosphorylated myosin-regulatory

light chain (p-MRLC) to label active myosin, F-actin to label the actin 
cytoskeleton, E-cadherin to label cell–cell contacts and paxillin for focal 
contacts (Fig. 3a–d, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Methods). Strikingly, we 
found that, while E-cadherin and F-actin were largely concentrated at 
the cell–cell interface, p-MRLC was almost absent at the interface but 
concentrated at two bright zones near the boundary of the cell–cell 
junction. Immuno-fluorescence paxillin staining and live imaging of 
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) further revealed that 
focal contacts were also concentrated near the interface boundary 
(Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6c (VASP)). Live imaging combining 
markers for actin and myosin cytoskeleton, cell–cell adhesion and 
focal contacts showed that cadherins are recruited by both cells at the 
cell–cell interface, while myosin clusters and focal contacts appear dis-
tributed within the cortex on opposite sides near the doublet interface, 
judging from their position relative to the interface shape (Fig. 3a–g, 
Extended Data Fig. 4d, Supplementary Videos 6–10 and schematic 
in Fig. 3e). In some cases, myosin clusters appear to pull to deform 
locally the cell–cell interface (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supple-
mentary Video 10). Finally, the observed myosin dynamics (Extended 
Data Fig. 4d–h, Supplementary Section 8 and Supplementary Video 8)

shows cluster movements, with typical cluster velocities around 
0.1–1 μm min−1.
T o quantify the cortical myosin distribution, we defined a polarity 
vector p associated with each cell, which was obtained from the myosin 
signal intensity on the cell surface, corrected for a gradient in the z direc-
tion away from the microscope objective and for the anisotropy of the 
point spread function (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e and Supplementary 
Section 5.2). In line with our observation of myosin clusters, the two 
cell polarity vectors were consistently pointing away from the axis 
joining the doublet at an angle of nearly 90°, in opposite directions in 
each cell of the doublet (Fig. 3h–k). The cortical myosin polarity axis 
was correlated with both the doublet rotation axis and the orientation 
of the yin–yang interface deformation (Fig. 3l,m). T o better visualize 
the distribution of cortical myosin, we averaged the myosin intensity 
profile in a reference frame defined by the rotation vector and the cell 
doublet axis. This again revealed strong myosin accumulation near the 
cell–cell interface, away from the direction of cell motion (Fig. 3n and 
Extended Data Fig. 7). In contrast, we find that single cells that do not 
undergo rotation exhibit a polarized myosin distribution that is fixed in 
time (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Section 6). Overall, we 
conclude that the cortical myosin accumulates in clusters whose posi-
tions are correlated with rotation and interface deformation (Fig. 3o).
An active surface model recapitulates doublet 
rotation
We then wondered if we could understand how doublets were physically 
rotating and the complex shape of their cell–cell interfaces (Fig. 4a  
and Extended Data Fig. 8). We considered a physical model where each 
cell is described as an active viscous surface, subjected to active ten-
sion (Supplementary Section 9). Cell–cell adhesion is described by an 
interaction potential acting between all pairs of cell surface points, with 
short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction. Surface flows 
are obtained from force balance equations at the cell surface, both on 
the outer interface and at the cell–cell contact, taking into account an 
external friction force proportional to the cell surface velocity. Polarity 
vectors were assigned to each cell, opposite to each other and oriented 
with a constant angle away from the axis joining the cells. A profile of 
active tension was imposed around the cell polarity axis (Supplemen-
tary Section 9.3). This profile was set using measurements of cortical 
myosin intensity in a reference frame defined by the cell polarity vec-
tor and the axis joining the doublet cells (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data 
Figs. 7 and 8a,c). Simulations were performed using the Interacting 
Active Surfaces (IAS) numerical framework20 (Fig. 4d and Supplemen-
tary Sections 9.1 and 9.2). Solving for the doublet dynamics, we found 
that a cortical flow emerges, the cell doublet rotates, and the cell–cell 
interface acquires a deformed shape (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 8f 
and Supplementary Video 11). The simulated interface shape was a 
pure yin–yang deformation correlated with the direction of rotation 
(Fig. 4e,f), the doublet was elongated, and the major axis of elongation 
was rotating with the doublet (Fig. 4g), as observed experimentally 
(Fig. 2c,h). Other deformation modes were however absent, in contrast 
to experiments (Figs. 2g and 4f). Both the simulated rotational velocity 
and the magnitude of the interface deformation increase with the mag-
nitude of the active tension modulation (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary 
Fig. 4 | Interacting active surface simulations of a rotating doublet.

Section 9.4). T o test this prediction, we compared the magnitudes 
of the rotation and the yin–yang interface deformation mode with 
the variation in the cortical myosin polarity and found that they were 
indeed correlated (Fig. 4h,i). The simulated rotation magnitude was 
comparable to experiments for parameters giving rise to cortical flows 
of ~0.1 μm min−1, comparable to the observed speed of myosin clusters 
(Extended Data Figs. 4d–h and 8f).
Curie principle applied to doublet interface 
shape
We then wondered how we could explain the emergence of modes of 
interface deformation other than the yin–yang shape. We reasoned that 
the Curie principle, stating that ‘the symmetries of the causes are to 
be found in the effects’21,22, implies that molecular cues guiding inter-
face deformations should satisfy symmetry rules consistent with the 
observed interface shape (leaving aside the possibility of spontaneous 
symmetry breaking). We classified a set of configurations of doublets 
and polarity axis according to their symmetry properties (Fig. 4j). A 
configuration where cell polarities are in the same plane but shifted 
in opposite directions away from the doublet axis belongs to the C2h 
point group in Schoenflies notation23. As a result, such a doublet should 
exhibit yin–yang and three-fold interface deformation, as observed in 
simulations (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8d). In contrast, tension 
asymmetry between the two cells of the doublets should give rise to the 
bowl deformation mode. Meanwhile, a nematic configuration of active 
tension distribution, with different intensities in each cell, should give 
rise to the bowl and saddle-node deformation mode (Fig. 4j). Simulating 
doublets with varying profiles of active tension confirmed these predic-
tions (Fig. 4j). We then verified if this relationship between modes of 
cortical myosin distribution and modes of interface deformation could 
be observed in experiments. Indeed, we found that the magnitude of 
the bowl deformation mode was correlated with the difference in the 
average cortical myosin intensity of the two doublet cells (Fig. 4k,l). We 
also noticed that the distribution of cortical myosin had a secondary, 
less concentrated cluster opposite to the main myosin cluster (Fig. 3n 
and Extended Data Fig. 7). We reasoned that this secondary cluster was 
giving rise to a nematic distribution of cortical myosin, quantified by a 
nematic tensor24. Indeed, we measured a negative correlation between 
the nematic tensor of the saddle-node interface deformation mode and 
the difference of the cortical myosin nematic tensor between the two 
doublet cells (Fig. 4m). We then verified that simulating a doublet with 
an active tension profile summing a polar, nematic distribution and a 
difference in average tension between the two doublets cells resulted 
in a complex interface shape with a similar mode decomposition as in 
experiments (Fig. 4j, last row and Fig. 2g). We conclude that the complex 
shape of the doublet interface can be understood on the basis of sym-
metry principles from the cortical myosin distribution in the doublet.
Perturbing myosin clusters affects doublet shape 
and motion
We then reasoned that, if the myosin clusters are responsible for cell 
rotation and interface deformation, perturbing their activity and 
localization would affect the cell doublet shape and motion. Indeed, 
treatment with the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin (Fig. 5a) resulted in 
simultaneous rotation arrest, flattening of the interface and disappear-
ance of clusters of phosphorylated myosin (Fig. 5a–c and Extended 
Data Fig. 9a,b) The effect of the blebbistatin-induced arrest of rotation 
was reversible. When we washed out the inhibitor, doublets retrieved 
rotational motion and a bent interface (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Sup-
plementary Video 12). By incubating cells with inhibitors of Rac1 and 
Arp2/3 (CK666; Methods), which are key regulators of actin polymeriza-
tion during single cell motility25,26, we also tested whether actin polym-
erization was required for the rotation. Doublet rotations were arrested 
upon treatment but resumed after washing (Extended Data Fig. 10 
and Supplementary Videos 13 and 14). This arrest was accompanied 
by a disassembly of myosin clusters (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Sup-
plementary Videos 13 and 14).
We then aimed at specifically altering the two opposite myosin 
spots using laser ablation (Fig. 5d). This induced transient arrest of 
the rotation and interface flattening. Following a lag time of ~10 min, 
rotation restarted with a simultaneous increase in rotation velocity and 
interface deformation (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Video 15). Suppress-
ing the gradient of active tension in the simulation also suppressed the 
rotation (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Video 16). T o generate additional 
ectopic local myosin clusters, we then engineered a stable optogenetic 
cell line that we used to locally activate Rho (Fig. 5f , Supplementary 
Video 17 and Methods). Transient Rho activation resulted in ectopic 
myosin activation at the cell cortex comparable in intensity and size 
to spontaneous myosin clusters. This new cluster triggered the dis -
placement of the doublet away from the region of activation while 
the doublet kept rotating (Fig. 5f–h). Introducing an ectopic region 
of increased active tension in simulations resulted in a similar drift 
of the doublet (Fig. 5f–h and Supplementary Video 18). Altogether, 
these results support the central role of myosin clusters for driving 
doublet rotation.
Discussion
Our analysis shows that doublet rotation arises from myosin clusters 
positioned away from the axis joining the two doublet cells. Therefore, 
the doublet cell rotation requires cell–cell interactions to trigger the 
shift of the cell polarity axis. Consistent with this picture, in our experi-
mental setup, single cells do not rotate. It has been reported that, in a 
bilayered Matrigel, which provides an external polarization axis, single 
MDCK cells rotate11. In this situation, the environment is providing a 
preferred direction. It would be interesting to track the cortical myosin 
distribution in cells rotating in these conditions to test whether the 
polarity-based mechanism we propose also applies in that context.
Which mechanisms result in myosin cluster formation? Clusters 
could emerge by spontaneous symmetry breaking from an initially sym-
metric configuration where the cell polarities are pointing towards each 
other (Fig. 4j). The dynamics of the increase in the rotation magnitude 
after cell division (Fig. 1f), which resembles an exponential increase fol-
lowed by saturation, is consistent with such a scenario. The position of 
myosin clusters could be related to the small and transient protrusions 
that are sent by each cell beyond the interface at the cortex (Fig. 3f), 
consistent with a mechanism reported in refs. 27,28. Alternatively, they 
form in response to cell interface deformation and induce rotation and 
further cell interface deformation, with the positive feedback loop at 
the origin of the instability and spontaneous symmetry breaking nec-
essary for rotation. Among the deformation modes we have analysed, 
the yin–yang mode has the right symmetry property to be coupled 
to a shift of the two cell polarities away from the doublet axis, which 
occurs in opposite directions in each cell of the doublet (Fig. 4j). Inter-
estingly, we also observed that, following cell division, a myosin-dense 
cluster forms at the centre of the doublet interface and then appears 
to relocate towards the periphery of the contact (Extended Data Fig. 9c 
and Supplementary Video 19). We note that myosin clusters have also 
been reported to generate stress in cytokinesis29. We also observe that 
focal contacts are polarized within each cell of the doublet, such that 
a myosin cluster in one cell is in close vicinity to a region dense in focal 
contacts within the opposite cell. This organization suggests either a 
common origin for myosin and focal contact distribution or a polariza-
tion mechanism relying on negative feedback between cortical myosin 
and focal contacts. Possibly, forces resulting from the inhomogeneous 
distribution of cortical myosin promote adhesion contacts through 
a reinforcement mechanism27,28,30,31. Interestingly, we observed that, 
although E-cadherin KO doublets were still rotating, inhibition of Arp2/3 
or Rac1 stopped the rotation, indicating that Arp2/3 and Rac1 activity are 
required for force generation by myosin in the cortex or that additional 
protrusive activity participates to propelling the doublet.

Our study shows that epithelial cell doublets allow to bridge the 
gap between microscopic players involved in cell motion and collec-
tive tissue dynamics. We propose that the spontaneous rotation we 
observed here is a manifestation of the basic principles of cell interac-
tions, involving cross-talks of cell polarity between neighbouring cells 
and polarity-oriented mechanical interactions between the cells and 
their environment. The ubiquity of collective rotations observed in vari-
ous cell types in vitro suggests that they indeed emerge from generic 
principles. Analysis of the symmetries, here through the Curie princi-
ple, helps in making sense of these complex interactions. It would be 
interesting to see how basic rules of cell polarity interactions combine 
with mechanical forces to generate tissue self-organisation beyond 
collective cell rotation.

Methods
Cell culture and cell lines
Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. All following steps 
are performed under a sterile hood.
The maintenance of MDCK II cell lines was done using high 
Glutamax modified Eagle’s medium (ref. 41090-028; Gibco), 5% v/v 
foetal bovine serum (ref. 10270106; South America Gibco), 1% v/v 
non-essential amino acid (ref. 11140-050; Gibco), 1% v/v sodium pyru-
vate (ref. 11360-039; Gibco) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. MDCK cells 
were replated every 3–4 days when they reached 70–95% confluency. 
Trypsin-EDTA was used to detach the cells from the plate and with a 
seeding density of 5 × 104 cm−2. T o generate doublets, single cells were 
embedded in a Matrigel close to the surface. Coverslips were activated 
by O2 plasma, and 100% Matrigel (356231; Corning BV) was then used to 
coat coverslips. Following a 10 min incubation at 37 °C, 100% Matrigel 
was polymerized and formed a basal layer. Single cells were deposited 
at a density of 15,000 cells cm−2. After 10 min of incubation, unattached 
cells and excess medium were removed. Next a drop of 10 μl 100% 
Matrigel was deposited. After polymerization of Matrigel at 37 °C in 
the incubator, culture medium was further added. For doublets with 
distinct cells, cells were centrifuged into micro-cavities, and their 
diameters were adapted to contain two cells32. By default, sister cells 
are used for representation unless indicated.
We prepared the following stable cell lines: MDCK II E-cadherin- 
GFP/Podocalyxin-mScarlett/Halo-CAAX was used to visualize the 
cell–cell junction and the lumen. T o generate new myosin clusters 
by opto-genetics, we prepared a stable MDCK II cell line expressing 
iLID-LARG::mVenus 33, engineered to be membrane-anchored by a 
slowly diffusing Stargazin membrane anchor 34 combined with the 
DH/PH domain of the Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) 35. This 
cell line allowed us to activate Rho locally and trigger the local recruit-
ment of myosin. We visualized Rho activity with an active Rho sensor 
(2xrGBD-dT omato) and myosin localization with MRLC-iRFP703. We 
also used the following cell lines: MDCK II VASP-GFP for tracking focal 
contacts36, MDCK II MRLC-KO1/E-cadherin-mNG to follow myosin and 
cell–cell junctions37, MDCK II MRLC-GFP38, MDCK II E-cadherin-GFP, 
MDCK II E-cadherin-DsRed39, MDCK II Actin-GFP (Nelson laboratory) 
and MDCK II Lifeact-iRFP. These cell lines allowed us to track specific 
correlations between rotation and adhesion or cytoskeleton protein 
localizations. E-cadherin was also used for segmentation purposes. 
MDCK II E-cadherin-KO18 was used to study the role of adherens junc-
tion in rotating doublet. T o visualize F-actin live, we also used SiR-Actin 
(500 nM, T ebu-Bio, 251SC001). Each experimental condition (biologi-
cal repeat, denoted by N) was reproduced at least three times on at least 
ten doublets (denoted by n in captions).
Drug treatments and immuno-fluorescence staining
T o investigate the role of myosin, we used blebbistatin (Sigma, B0560) 
to inhibit myosin with the following steps. Timelapses of samples were 
acquired under the microscope, and the medium was then changed by 
a medium containing 10 μM of blebbistatin. Following 1 h incubation, 
samples were washed three times with fresh medium. Samples were 
further imaged to visualize the eventual re-initiation of rotation.
T o study the role of actin, the Arp2/3 inhibitor (CK-666, SML0006; 
Sigma) and Rac1 inhibitor (Z62954982; Merck Millipore) were used to 
interfere with actin dynamics 8. Drug assays were performed follow -
ing this protocol: for 30 min doublet dynamics were recorded before 
drug treatment, then 50 μM CK-666 or 50 μM Rac1 inhibitors were 
incubated during 30 min. The doublet dynamics were recorded for 
2 h after washout.
For immunostaining9, samples were washed with PBS and then 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS for 15 min. T o 
permeabilize cells, cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 
15 min and then a blocking solution made of 1% normal goat serum in 
PBS 1× was added overnight. The primary antibody was added directly 
to the blocking solution for 2 days at 4 °C. Following three washing 
steps, samples were stained with the relevant secondary antibodies for 
2 h at room temperature. We used the following primary antibodies: 
Anti-E-cadherin (Ab11512; Abcam), Anti-Phospho-Myosin Light Chain 
2 (#3674; Cell Signaling T echnology), Anti-Paxillin (Ab32084; Abcam) 
and Alexa FluorTM Phalloidin 488 (A12379; Thermo Fisher) to visual-
ize F-actin. Samples were washed three times in PBS and mounted on 
a home-made sample holder system for imaging and conservation.
Microscopy
High-throughput imaging was done using a spinning disk microscope 
with an inverted Leica spinning disk DMI8 equipped with an Orca Flash 
2.0 camera (2,048 × 2,018 pixels with a size of 6.5 μm) using a 63× 
glycerol objective (numerical aperture of 1.3). The microscope was 
equipped with an incubation chamber to maintain the samples at 37 °C, 
5% CO2 and 85% humidity conditions.
T o record the initiation of rotation, MDCK doublets were imaged 
for 5 h after cell seeding. Three-dimensional stacks were acquired with 
a z step of 1 μm and x–y resolution of 0.206 or 0.103 μm, every 10 min 
up to 12 h.
Confocal imaging of fixed samples was performed using the same 
setup. Laser power and digital gain settings were unchanged within 
a given session to ease quantitative comparison of expression levels 
among doublets.
We locally activated Rho with the scanning head of a confocal 
microscope (Leica SP8-UV) with a 458 nm laser each 10 s for 20 min, 
taking an image every minute. We could follow RhoA activity with a 
Rho binding domain sensor for active Rho (2xrGBD::dT omato)40 and 
myosin with the MRLC::iRFP703 probe.
Image analysis
Three-dimensional segmentation of cells was performed using a 
custom-written ImageJ macro involving the LimeSeg plugin 41 (Sup-
plementary Section 1). The centre of mass and surfaces of cells were 
computed from the segmented three-dimensional (3D) meshes using a 
written Python code. For the velocity measurements, rotational veloc-
ity of cells was computed using the cell-to-cell centre of mass vector, 
the velocity of cell 1 and the velocity of cell 2 (Supplementary Section 2).
Segmentation of the interface was performed using a custom -
ized Python code from the 3D meshes of each cell in a doublet. The 3D 
point cloud of the interface was then fitted to a polynomial function of 
degree three. Characterization of the interface deformation and shape 
was then performed on the fitted surface (Supplementary Section 4).
The fluorescence intensity signal of myosin was extracted from 
images and attributed to vertices of 3D meshes. The myosin distribu-
tion was then characterized by a polarity vector and a nematic tensor. 
We correlated these descriptors to the interface shape and the doublet 
rotation (Supplementary Section 5).
Planar projections of the basal (E-cadherin) signal were created 
using a custom Python code (Supplementary Section 7).
For the visualization and 3D rendering, we used Paraview 42 
software.
IAS simulation framework
Simulations of rotating doublets were performed using the IAS frame-
work. A polarity is introduced for each cell, which modulates the active 
tension profile along its surface. This leads to the emergence of a 
cortical flow that propels the cells through friction with the external 
medium. The integrity of the doublet is maintained using an adhesion 
interaction potential. See Supplementary Section 9 for a complete 
description of the simulations and parameters used.
Statistical tests and data visualization
We used a bootstrapping approach for all statistical tests performed43. 
Given N observed quantities (x 1, x2, …, xN), we compute an estimate 
Nature Physics
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-024-02460-w
F({xi}) of an underlying parameter of interest f. F can be the sample 
mean (Figs. 2c,h , 3l,m, 4m, 5b,c,e,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e), a 
correlation coefficient (Fig. 4h,i,l) or another estimate (Fig. 3j and 
Supplementary Section 5.4). Using random sampling with replace -
ment, we generate n samples and construct a probability distribution 
Bn that approximates the distribution of the true value of f  given the 
observed data (x1, x2, …, xN). The P values of all the tests are then gener-
ated using Bn. For instance, the P value Pn associated to the hypothesis 
that f is positive is the probability PBn (F < 0) (see ref. 43, chapter 15.4). 
Since Pn is obtained by dividing the number of bootstrap samples {x∗
i } 
for which F({x∗
i }) < 0 by the total number of samples n, lower P values 
require more samples to be accurately computed. In particular, given 
an asymptotic P  value P ∞ > 0, the probability to obtain P n = 0 with  
n samples is (1 − P ∞)n, which is equal to 0.67% with P ∞ = 10 −4 and 
n = 50,000 samples. We therefore performed the tests in Figs. 2c,h, 
3l,m, 4h,i,m, 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5e (λz) with 50,000 samples, 
and since we obtained Pn = 0, we inferred that P < 10−4. For Figs. 3j, 4l, 
5e,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e ( λx, λy), we provide 95% confidence 
intervals for the P values, obtained from 10 replicates of 50,000 (1,000 
in Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 5e) bootstrap samples. For the cor -
relation tests in Fig. 4h,i,l, we generated independent samples of the 
correlation defined as ⟨(a−⟨a⟩) (b−⟨b⟩) ⟩/(σaσb) (for two signals a and 
b with respective standard deviations of σ a and σ b). This correlation 
takes values between −1 and 1.
Violin plots are used in Figs. 2c,h and 4g to visualize statistical 
distributions. There, the central line corresponds to the mean while 
the extremum lines correspond to the minimum and maximum of the 
distribution.

Reporting Summary
Nature Portfolio wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency 
in reporting. For further information on Nature Portfolio policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.
Software and code
Policy information about availability of computer code
Data collection Metamorph was used to acquire the images on a Leica Spinning Disk microscope as described in the Methods section. 
Simulation results were generated using a custom C++ code adapted from a previously published code available at https://github.com/
torressancheza/ias .
Data analysis FIJI was used to contrast and overlay images.  
Cell segmentation was performed with previously published FIJI plugin LimeSeg 0.4.2 (https://imagej.net/plugins/limeseg). 
All quantifications and data analysis were then performed using custom Python codes as described in the Methods section and 
Supplementary Information.  
Visualisation and rendering of 3D meshes were performed using Paraview Software 5.10.1. 
All plots were generated with Python (version 3.9.10).
For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and 
reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.

Ethics oversight n/a
Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.
Field-specific reporting
Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.
Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences  Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences
For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf
Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
Sample size  All quantifications were performed for at least n=12 cell doublets, except for Fig. 5b,c (4 doublets), Fig.5e (9 doublets), Fig. 5g,h (9 doublets) 
and Ext. Fig. 1c (red curve, 6 doublets).
Data exclusions No points were excluded from the data analysis. 
Replication All experiments were systematically performed at least 3 times and gave similar results.
Randomization Cell doublets were chosen to be imaged randomly among a large population. The subset of doublets used for segmentation were chosen 
randomly among those with a rotation axis approximatively aligned with the microscope Z-axis (with random clockwise or counterwise 
rotation). This allowed better segmentation of cells.
Blinding n/a
Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods
We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, 
system or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response.
