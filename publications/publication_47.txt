Brain development and spinal cord 
regeneration require neurite sprouting and 
growth cone navigation in response to extension 
and collapsing factors present in the 
extracellular environment. These external 
guidance cues control neurite growth cone 
extension and retraction processes through 
intracellular protein phosphorylation of 
numerous cytoskeletal, adhesion, and polarity 
complex signaling proteins. However, the 
complex kinase/substrate signaling networks 
that mediate neuritogenesis have not been 
investigated.  Here, we compare the neurite 
phosphoproteome under growth and retraction 
conditions using neurite purification 
methodology combined with mass spectrometry. 
More than 4000 non-redundant 
phosphorylation sites from 1883 proteins have 
been annotated and mapped to signaling 
pathways that control kinase/phosphatase 
networks, cytoskeleton remodeling, and 
axon/dendrite specification. Comprehensive 
informatics and functional studies revealed a 
compartmentalized ERK 
activation/deactivation cytoskeletal switch that 
governs neurite growth and retraction, 
respectively.  Our findings provide the first 
system-wide analysis of the phosphoprotein 
signaling networks that enable neurite growth 
and retraction and reveal an important 
molecular switch that governs neuritogenesis. 
Neuritogenesis is a dynamic process involving 
the extension of long, thin protrusions called 
neurites that will subsequently differentiate into 
long axons or an elaborate dendritic arbor (1-4).  
This highly polarized process occurs through the 
segmentation from the soma periphery of a 
microtubule-rich shaft capped with a growth cone, 
which itself is characterized by an actin-rich 
lamellipodium with numerous filopodial 
extensions and integrin-mediated adhesive 
contacts. Understanding this process is crucial as it 
is necessary for proper wiring of the brain and 
nerve regeneration, and has been linked to 
numerous neurodegenerative diseases. 
Although cultured neurons randomly form 
neurites in vitro, in vivo this process is 
orchestrated by gradients of chemoattractants, 
extracellular matrix proteins, and collapsing 
factors that precisely guide neurite initiation and 
advancement (5,6). This occurs in a polarized and 
highly controlled manner and relies on spatially 
regulated mechanisms for gradient sensing, 
membrane trafficking, integrin-mediated adhesion, 
and organization of the actin-microtubule 
cytoskeleton (5-8). These events are largely 
orchestrated by numerous surface 
guidance/repulsion and adhesion receptors that 
signal to the cell interior through multiple kinase 
activation and substrate phosphorylation events 
(7,9-17).  Protein phosphorylation is a critical 
posttranslational modification that regulates

protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activity, 
and subcellular localization. The reversible 
addition of PO-4 to serine, theronine, and tyrosine 
amino acid residues is mediated by more than 500 
kinases and over 150 phosphatases (18-20).  In 
many cases, kinases phosphorylate specific amino 
acids in the context of a consensus recognition 
sequence.  For example ERK is a proline directed 
kinase that phosphorylates S/T residues with the 
consensus sequence PxS/TP where x can be a 
neutral or basic amino acid (21-24). The 
identification of phosphorylation sites in the 
context of a specific kinase recognition sequence 
of given substrate has proven quite useful in the 
predication of kinase activation events in the cell 
(25-27). Also, kinases themselves can be 
phosphorylated at specific sites that are known to 
promote enzymatic activation which can be used 
to predict kinase activity in the cell.  This is 
further enriched by computational models that 
predict higher order contextual features of kinases 
such as protein scaffolding, subcellular 
localization, and expression patterns (13,25-28).  
When combined, in silico programs have been 
shown to predict kinase activity with significant 
accuracy.  This approach has been applied to large 
phosphoproteomic data sets consisting of 
thousands of phosphorylation sites revealing 
important kinase signaling networks that modulate 
cell migration, DNA damage, and yeast biology 
(13,25,29,30). 
While significant progress has been made in 
identifying specific signals regulating 
neuritogenesis, a system-wide analysis of the 
phosphoprotein signals that control this process 
has not been investigated.  Consequently, our 
understanding of the complex kinase/substrate 
signaling networks that regulate neurite formation 
and guidance are not defined.  Here we describe a 
microporous filter method that facilitates selective 
purification of neurites undergoing growth or 
retraction. This fractionation method combined 
with immobilized metal-ion affinity 
chromatography (IMAC) and LC-MS protein 
identification technologies facilitated the 
identification of thousands of protein 
phosphorylation signatures that mediate neurite 
extension or retraction events induced by growth 
promoting or collapsing stimuli, respectively. 
Functional annotation and kinase activity 
predications in silico reveal phosphoprotein 
networks controlling cytoskeletal remodeling, 
axon/dendrite specification, and cell adhesion.  
Kinase signaling analysis and cell-based assays 
revealed that an integrin/MEK/ERK signaling 
pathway operates as a critical switch controlling 
neurite extension and retraction dynamics.

Purification of growing and retracting neurites. 
Procedures for the culturing and biochemical 
preparation of extending neurites from NIE-115 
cells using 3.0 μm microporous filters were the 
same as described before (35). To purify retracting 
neurites, NIE-115 cells were allowed to extend 
neurites for various times (8-24 hours) towards 
laminin (10 μg/ml, Millipore) then LPA (1 μM) 
was added to the media in either the upper or 
lower chamber to induce retraction for the times 
indicated in the text. Extending or retracting 
neurites or their corresponding cell bodies were 
differentially harvested into lysis buffer for 
biochemical analyses as described (35). For 
GTPase activity assays, lysates were prepared as 
previously described (35). To block LPA-induced 
neurite retraction 10 μM Y-27632 was added to

the chamber for 60 minutes prior to LPA 
stimulation. To block ERK activation, 25 μM 
PD98059 was added to the chamber for the 
indicated times. Transient transfection of NIE-115 
with the plasmids, neurite imaging, and 
immunofluorescence of the neurite cytoskeleton 
was performed as described (35). To prepare 
samples for proteomics analysis, extending or 
retracting neurites or their corresponding cell 
bodies were differentially harvested into lysis 
buffer of freshly made 7M Urea, 0.5% NP-40 in 
50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) 
containing 50 nM calyculin A and 0.2 mM 
vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors. After 
incubation on ice for 30 minutes, insoluble matter 
was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 20 
minutes. 
Phosphopeptide Enrichment and Capillary 
HPLC-MS/MS Analysis.  Protein samples (five 
biological replicates each for both extending and 
retracting neurites) were digested with trypsin at 
room temperature. Tryptic peptides were desalted 
and methyl esterified (250 µg for each sample), 
followed by immobilized metal-ion (Fe3+) affinity 
chromatography (IMAC) to enrich 
phosphopeptides, as detailed in the recent 
report(36). After IMAC enrichment, aliquots (1/6 
of the IMAC elution) were analyzed on a 
ThermoElectron LTQ-Orbitrap (Waltham, MA) 
coupled to an automated dual-column 
phosphoproteome nano-HPLC platform assembled 
in-house.  The LC gradient (A = 100 mM HOAc in 
H2O, B = 70% acetonitrile/100 mM HOAc in H 2O) 
was 0-70% B for ~180 min. For each sample, two 
technical replicates of LC-MS analyses were 
performed (36).  
Database search and peptide identification. 
Phosphopeptides were identified from MS/MS 
spectra using SEQUEST by searching against the 
mouse IPI database. For confident phosphopeptide 
identifications, the false discovery rate (FDR) at 
peptide spectrum level was controlled at ≤  0.5 % 
using in-house developed software (37). This 
program also measured the probability of correct 
phosphorylation site localization in each identified 
peptide by calculating the AScore for each 
phosphorylation site (38), and the assigned top 
phosphopeptide sequence was taken as the final 
peptide identification for a given spectrum.  
Evaluation of phosphopeptide changes in 
growth and retracting neurite.  We applied the 
spectral count method to evaluate the changes of 
phosphopeptides. The total spectral counts for 
each identified phosphopeptide in each neurite 
condition and their ratios were used to semi-
quantitatively estimate their abundance in each 
condition (39).  
Bioinformatics. The pathway analysis was 
performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
software (Ingenuity Systems, 
http://www.ingenuity.com) as previously 
described (48). Briefly, we queried all 
phosphoproteins against the IPKB to search all 
possible pathways that could be represented by the 
query proteins. The significance of each pathway 
was evaluated by the right-tailed Fisher's Exact, 
which measures how likely it is the query proteins 
are relevant to the pathway. For the kinase-
phosphorylation substrate relationship analysis, we 
used NetworkIN software to assign possible 
kinases to each identified site (25). The data used 
for the analysis was pre-formatted using in-house 
software to meet the format requirement of 
NetworkIN 
(http://networkin.info/newPrediction.php). 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Model system for purification of growing and 
retracting neurites. Our previous work has shown 
that extending neurites can be purified from the 
cell body of NIE-115 cells using culture chambers 
equipped with 3.0 μm microporus filters (Fig.1A) 
(35). We utilized these NIE-115 cells because they 
can be grown in large numbers for large-scale 
biochemical analysis and have been well 
characterized for their neuron-like properties.  
Laminin was coated on the bottom of the filter 
which serves as a potent and directional cue for 
neurite initiation (35,40-42). Neurite extension 
through the pore to the lower surface of the filter 
is β1-integrin dependent and occurs in a highly 
directional and polarized manner (35).  Therefore, 
because the cell body remains on the surface of the 
filter and neurite growth occurs exclusively 
through the pore to the lower surface, it is possible 
to selectively purify this structure from the 
polarized neuron for spatial proteomic analysis.  
Neurite growth under these conditions is linear for 
up to 24 hours, reaching a maximum around 36-48 
hours after plating (Fig. 1A-C).  The optimal time

to harvest extending neurites for biochemical 
analyses was 18-20 hours post plating on the 
laminin coated filters.  At this time the majority of 
neurites are elongating, have well defined growth 
cones, and provide sufficient amounts of neurite 
protein for MS analysis. To obtain retracting 
neurites, we added the collapsing factor, LPA, to 
the lower chamber containing neurites that had 
been allowed to extend to the lower surface for 18 
hours (43-45).  The kinetics of retraction is shown 
in Fig. 1D. Retracting neurites were harvested 10-
15 minutes after LPA stimulation because the 
majority of neurites were in the process of 
retraction and sufficient amounts of neurite protein 
can still be obtained from the filter at this time.  It 
is notable that applying LPA selectively to the cell 
bodies on the upper chamber surface did not 
significantly induce neurite retraction. These 
findings indicate that the neurite and soma 
compartments of polarized neurons are spatially 
sensitive to this collapsing agent through an 
unknown mechanism.  The spatial sensitivity to 
guidance cues like LPA is indicative of highly 
polarized neurons (5-7,17,46-51). Also, the neurite 
purification system is amenable to other cells and 
ECM proteins including pheochromocytoma PC12 
cells on fibronectin and laminin (35). These 
findings together with our previous work indicate 
that the microporous system provides a robust 
method to selectively purify growing or retracting 
neurites.   
Comparison of the neurite phosphoproteomes 
from growing and retracting neurites. The ability 
to selectively purify growing or retracting neurites 
independent of the soma provided a unique 
opportunity to study the 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms 
and kinase networks governing neuritogenesis in a 
highly spatial manner.  To quantify relative 
changes in specific phosphorylation sites in 
purified growing and retracting neurites, we used 
immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography to 
capture phosphopeptides and a liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry platform to 
identify parent proteins and their sites of 
phosphorylation as described in Experimental 
Procedures (52-56). In total 3512 phosphopeptides 
were identified by MS/MS from growing and 
retracting neurites, representing 1883 
phosphoproteins and 4145 non-redundant 
phosphorylation sites (sTable 1). Of these peptides, 
2676 were singly phosphorylated and 836 were 
doubly or multiply phosphorylated. The protein 
identifications and sites of phosphorylation were 
confidently assigned with an FDR of 1%.  
A change in a specific phosphorylation site(s) 
within a phosphopeptide, was considered 
significant with a total spectral count of 2 or more 
and if it either increased or decreased by at least 
1.5 fold or uniquely identified in the growing or 
retracting neurite fraction. All other 
phosphorylation sites were considered equally 
abundant with no specific change in both 
conditions. Before evaluating of the relative 
abundance of a specific phosphopeptide in 
growing or retracting neurites, we first filtered the 
phosphopeptide dataset to remove redundancy 
because some peptides from the same protein may 
contain exactly the same phosphorylation sites due 
to miscleavage during tryptic digestion. After 
removing the redundancy, we obtained a total of 
3203 phosphopeptides with unique 
phosphorylation status, i.e., even two peptides 
with the same amino acid sequences from the 
same protein must have different phosphorylation 
sites. The growth to retraction ratios of all 
phosphorylation sites are shown in sTable 1. 
Using these criteria, 513 phosphopeptides were 
increased in growing neurites, 368 
phosphopeptides were increased in retracting 
neurites, and 543 phosphopeptides were equally 
abundant.  In total, 531 proteins were observed to 
have altered phosphorylation sites (> or < 1.5 fold) 
in response to neurite extension and retraction.  
Functional annotation of phosphoproteins 
involved in neurite growth and retraction. To find 
the functional interrelationship and assign the 
identified phosphoproteins that change during 
growth and retraction to their signaling pathways, 
we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) 
program and the Knowledge Base IPKB.  IPA is a 
system wide database of biological pathways 
created from multiple relationships of proteins, 
genes, and diseases. The IPA program can analyze 
large genomic or proteomic datasets to find the 
most statistically significant canonical pathways 
and protein networks relevant to the dataset based 
on the calculated probability score by searching 
the IPKB. Of a total of 78 pathways identified 
RhoA signaling was the most highly represented 
during the growth and retraction of the neurite 
(Fig. 2, sFig.1). This was expected as RhoA

signaling has been shown to play a prominent role 
in mediating neurite retraction in response to 
various collapsing factors including LPA 
(17,44,45,57-59). Also, given that the cytoskeletal 
remodeling is a key event during neurite growth 
and retraction it is not surprising that many 
pathways that regulate the cytoskeleton were 
highly represented including the small GTPases 
Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42, as well as integrin 
signaling, ILK, and FAK (1,7,8,17,35,46,47,60-
66). Furthermore, it is notable that ERK, PI3K, 
PKA kinase signaling are highly represented as 
these pathways are known to control cytoskeleton 
remodeling (66-74). Interestingly, in our previous 
work we reported that integrin and cytoskeleton-
associated proteins were also the most abundant 
proteins represented in the neurite compared to the 
soma compartment (35).  Thus, cytoskeletal 
proteins are highly enriched in the neurite and are 
the major targets modified by phosphorylation 
during neurite growth and retraction. Together 
these findings highlight the significance of using 
neurite purification methodology and 
phosphoprotein profiling to reveal signaling 
pathways that control neurite growth and 
retraction in a highly spatial manner.   
Assignment of Identified Phosphorylation Sites 
to Known Kinases. To determine the kinases 
responsible for phosphorylation of neurite proteins, 
we utilized NetworKIN, an integrative 
computational approach that greatly augments 
kinase motif-based approaches by using contextual 
information to enhance kinase-substrate 
assignments (25,28). The contextual information is 
integrated from curated pathway databases, protein 
interaction assays, scaffolding, co-occurrence in 
abstracts, physical protein interaction assays, 
mRNA expression studies, subcellular localization, 
and genomic context.  Combining the contextual 
information with existing matrices that identify 
kinase domain recognition motifs has been shown 
to improve the accuracy of kinase-substrate 
assignments by 2.5 fold. Using this approach, we 
were able to assign specific kinases to 73.3% (737 
out of 1006) of the phosphorylation sites that 
change during neurite growth or retraction (Fig. 3).  
Of the 82 different kinases assigned to this process, 
PKACA, BTK, MAPKAPK5, MAP2K4 (ERK), 
and PDGFRβ kinases showed the highest ratio for 
the number of substrate phosphorylations in the 
extending neurite versus retracting neurites, 
whereas ZAP70, PRKCZ, PRKACG, LCK 
showed the lowest ratio.  
ERK/MEK and RhoA signaling are spatially 
regulated during neurite growth and retraction. 
Our computational analyses indicate that 
MEK/ERK (MAP2K4) and RhoA signaling are 
highly modulated in growing/retracting neurites 
(Fig. 2, 3, and sFig. 1).  Because the role of ERK 
and RhoA signaling in controlling neurite 
dynamics are poorly understood, we investigate 
these signaling pathways in more detail (40,67,75-
81).  We first directly monitored MEK and ERK 
kinase activities in the soma/neurite fractions 
using Western blotting and phosphospecific 
antibodies that report kinase activities of these 
proteins due to phosphorylation of MEK-
S218/S222 and ERK TEY sequence (Fig. 4A).  
Both ERK and MEK kinase activities are highly 
increased in the extending neurite compared to the 
soma.  The total level of ERK protein was the 
same in the soma and neurite compartments while 
total MEK protein was slightly increased in the 
neurite.  These findings demonstrate that 
MEK/ERK activity is highly compartmentalized to 
the neurite during formation of this structure.  
Interestingly, LPA-med iated neurite collapse 
induced a rapid decrease in ERK and MEK 
activities, which correlated with neurite retraction 
kinetics (Fig. 4, A and B).  In contrast, Akt 
activity was not inhibited by LPA-induced neurite 
retraction (Fig. 4C).  These findings demonstrate 
that in polarized neurons MEK/ERK kinase 
activity is highly compartmentalized within the 
neurite and that during neurite collapse MEK/ERK 
activity is shut off.    
Integrins spatially regulate MEK 
phosphorylation/activation during neurite growth 
and retraction. We next investigated how MEK 
activity and its known regulators are spatially 
organized in growing and retracting neurites to 
mediate compartmentalized ERK activity. Because 
we previously showed that β 1 integrins drive 
directional neurite extension toward laminin in 
this model, we wanted to know if integrins played 
a role in MEK/ERK activation (35).  During cell 
adhesion and membrane spreading MEK1 activity 
has been shown to be regulated by integrin signals 
that promote phosphorylation of threonine 292 
(T292, human) and serine 298 (S298, human) (31-
34).  Integrins activate the small GTPases Rac and 
Cdc42, which activate PAK kinase, which in turn 
 by guest, on February 20, 2013www.jbc.org Downloaded from

phosphorylates MEK-S298 leading to increased 
catalytic activity towards ERK. Interestingly, 
current evidence indicates that phosphorylation of 
MEK-T292 by ERK itself negatively regulates 
MEK activity by decreasing PAK’s ability to 
phosphorylate MEK-S298. This reduces the 
efficiency of MEK activity towards ERK, thereby 
reducing its kinase activity. In this way ERK-
mediated phosphorylation of MEK-T292 serves as 
a negative feedback loop for self-regulation. 
However, the role of integrin/Rac/Cdc42/PAK to 
MEK-T292/S298 phosphorylation in neurite 
formation has not been investigated to date.  
Interestingly, in the soma we observed low 
levels of MEK-S298 phosphorylation that was 
concomitant with a high level of MEK-T292 
phosphorylation (Fig 4A). Conversely, in the 
extending neurite the level of MEK-T292 
phosphorylation was decreased relative to the 
level of MEK S298 phosphorylation, which is 
consistent with the high level of ERK activity in 
this compartment (Fig. 4A).  The increased ratio 
of MEK T292/S298 phosphorylation relative to 
the small pool of activated ERK present in the 
soma indicates that MEK activity is strongly 
inhibited in the soma due to the negative feedback 
modulation by ERK. These findings are consistent 
with the idea that the low level of ERK activity in 
the soma (Fig. 4A) results from the uncoupling of 
PAK from MEK-S298 phosphorylation.  On the 
other hand, negative feedback modulation of MEK 
by ERK in the neurite is significantly attenuated 
leading to robust MEK-S298 phosphorylation and 
increased ERK kinase activity.  Thus, in the 
neurite MEK/ERK activity is robust and strongly 
coupled to integrin/PAK signaling whereas in the 
soma ERK activity is low and not uncoupled to 
integrin/PAK signaling, due to strong negative 
feedback modulation by ERK. These findings 
suggest that integrins drive directional neurite 
extension through compartmentalized 
PAK/MEK/ERK signaling.  These findings are 
further supported by the observation that Cdc42 
and Rac activities are significantly elevated in the 
neurite compared to the soma (Fig. 4D).  We also 
detected several PAK family members (1, 2, 4) 
which are present in the neurite and modified by 
phosphorylation (sTable 1).  
LPA-induced neurite collapse disrupts 
integrin/PAK/Rac/Cdc42/MEK/ERK signaling. In 
the neurite, the level of S298 phosphorylation 
decreased in response to LPA-induced collapse, 
which correlated with the loss of ERK, Cdc42, and 
Rac activities (Fig. 4A-D). As expected, MEK-
T292 phosphorylation by ERK decreased in 
response to the loss of ERK activity (Fig. 4A). 
These findings suggest that LPA induces neurite 
collapse and ERK activity by interfering with 
integrin adhesion signaling to Rac/Cdc42/PAK 
and MEK-S298 phosphorylation.  In support of 
these findings, LPA blocked ERK activation and 
MEK S298 phosphorylation induced by integrin-
mediated NIE-115 cell attachment and spreading 
on laminin (Fig. 4G).  In addition, LPA was found 
to modulate tyrosine phosphorylation of several 
known integrin/focal adhesion-associated proteins 
(FAK, CAS, Abl, Lasp-1, Crk) (Fig. 4, E and 
F)(82-85).  It is also notable that LPA treatment 
decreased CAS phosphorylation, while it 
increased Crk Y221 phosphorylation, and Abl/Arg 
tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4E). These 
phosphorylation events have been previously 
associated with decreased CAS/Crk coupling and 
Rac activity in spreading cells downstream of 
integrin receptors (83-85).  Taken together these 
findings suggest that neurite extension involves 
integrin activation of the 
CAS/Crk/Rac/Cdc42/PAK/MEK-S298/ERK 
signaling pathway, whereas LPA-induced collapse 
blocks activation of integrin signaling leading to 
neurite detachment and retraction from the 
substrate.   
Integrin Regulation of MEK/ERK activity is 
necessary for neurite growth and retraction. To 
investigate the functional significance of 
MEK/ERK activity in neuritogenesis, we 
expressed mutationally activated MEK (MEK-
S211E/S222E, catalytically active MEK, MEK-
CA) in cells and then examined neurite formation 
towards laminin (Fig. 5, A and D). This 
phosphomimetic mutation promoted constitutive 
ERK activation and increased neurite formation 
(Fig 5A).  Interestingly, substitution of S298 with 
an alanine residue in MEK-CA partially reduced 
neurite formation suggesting that this site of 
phosphorylation does contribute to MEK/ERK-
induced neurite formation even when MEK is 
constitutively activated.  In contrast, MEK-CA 
with T292 mutated to alanine increased neurite 
formation probably because MEK is no longer 
susceptible to negative feedback regulation by 
ERK (Fig. 5A).  MEK kinase activity was required

for neurite formation, since treatment of cells with 
the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK 
activation and neurite formation on laminin (Fig. 
5B).  These findings indicate that MEK activation 
is sufficient and necessary to induce neurite 
formation and this response is partially regulated 
by MEK-S298/T292 phosphorylation. 
Inhibition of MEK/ERK activity is necessary 
for RhoA/ROCK/MLC-mediated neurite retraction. 
We next investigated whether MEK/ERK 
inactivation is required fo r neurite retraction.  
NIE-115 cells expressing a mutationally active 
form of MEK1 (MEK-CA) were treated with LPA 
and monitored for neurite retraction and ERK 
kinase inactivation.  Strikingly, LPA did not 
induce neurite retraction or inhibit ERK activation 
in MEK-CA cells, nor did it prevent S298 
phosphorylation (Fig. 5, C and D).  The fact that 
phosphorylation of MEK-S298 is not inhibited by 
LPA treatment in MEK-CA cells suggests that 
ERK activation provides a positive feedback 
mechanism to maintain integrin/Rac/Cdc42/PAK 
signaling in the neurite, thereby, preventing 
neurite detachment and retraction from the ECM.  
Interestingly, while inhibition of MEK/ERK 
activity with PD98059 did not induce neurite 
retraction by itself, it did increase retraction 
induced by a suboptimal dose of LPA (50% of the 
maximum) (Fig. 5E).  Thus, while the loss of ERK 
activity is not sufficient to induce neurite 
retraction per se, it does sensitize the cell to LPA-
mediated retraction. These findings suggest that 
LPA-induced neurite retraction not only requires 
ERK deactivation, but also involves 
activation/deactivation of additional signaling 
pathways.  RhoA activation is a likely candidate 
since LPA-induced neurite retraction requires 
RhoA activation, which facilitates ROCK-
mediated myosin contraction (sFig.1) (7,17,57,86-
88). Consistent with these observations, the 
ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632 prevented neurite 
retraction and myosin contraction as indicated by a 
decrease in serine 19 phosphorylation of myosin 
light chain (Fig. 6, A and B)(7,88).   Importantly, 
Y-27632 not only prevented neurite retraction, but 
also blocked LPA-induced ERK deactivation and 
MEK-S298 phosphorylation in the neurite fraction 
(Fig. 6B).  Thus, inhibition of 
integrin/RacCdc42/PAK/MEK/ERK signaling is 
necessary for LPA-RhoA/ROCK/MLC-mediated 
neurite retraction.  Based on our functional 
proteomics work and the work of others we 
proposed a model for how neurites extend and 
retract in response to laminin and LPA. The model 
is shown schematically in figure 6C and sFig.1 
and is discussed below. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Our ability to differentially isolate neurites in a 
state of growth or retraction for proteomic 
analyses provided a simple and robust system to 
globally profile thousands of protein 
phosphorylation and kinase changes that mediate 
neuritogenesis.  An important aspect of this model 
system is the ability to specifically isolate the 
neurite from the soma for proteomic analyses.  
This unique strategy allowed us to mine deeper 
into the neurite phosphoproteome uncovering 
many more low abundant phosphoproteins.  
Because of this, we were able to obtain a more 
precise picture of the complex spatial 
kinase/substrate networks that control neurite 
growth/retraction kinetics. Also, the neurite 
purification methods described here will likely 
transfer to other neuronal cell types, guidance 
factors and collapsing agents.   For example, we 
have previously reported that neurites can be 
readily purified from PC12 cells responding to 
laminin and fibronectin guidance cues (35). It may 
also be possible to selectively purify axons and 
dendrites from primary neurons for detailed 
proteomic analyses using specific differentiation 
and/or guidance factors.  In any case, the utility of 
this model system combined with the rapid 
progress being made in quantitative mass 
spectrometry will help provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of the neurite 
proteome and its spatial organization, which, in 
turn, will provide valuable insight into the various 
disease pathologies caused by deregulation of this 
process. 
Using NetworKIN, we find that a large panel 
of kinases are active during neurite growth, 
whereas a relatively reduced number of kinases 
are active during retraction. Many of these kinases 
have been previously implicated in the regulation 
of different aspects of neurite outgrowth. PKA 
(PKACA) can trigger neurite outgrowth by 
phosphorylating synapsins (89) and CREB (90). 
The MET receptor (MET ) enhances axonal 
outgrowth of cultured dorsal root ganglions by

potentiating NGF signaling (91).  The tyrosine 
kinase BTK ( BTK) phosphorylates the actin 
regulator N-WASP which is essential for neurite 
outgrowth (92). The cyclin kinase Cdk5 ( CDK5) 
regulates neurite and axon outgrowth by 
phosphorylating the kinase PAK1 and the 
microtubule associated protein MAP1B (93). 
GSK3 (GSK3A) phosphorylates the collapsin 
response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) to promote 
neurite elongation via microtubule assembly (94). 
The MAP kinase kinase MKK4 ( MAP2K4) and its 
substrate JNK ( MAPK9) have also been involved 
in the regulation of neurite outgrowth through the 
phosphorylation of the microtubule binding 
proteins MAP, MAP1, doublecortin and SGC10 
(95). Although these findings point to a wide array 
of kinase classes that regulate neuritrogenesis, it is 
likely that they work together in time and space to 
fine tune changes in the actin and microtubule 
cytoskeletons that drive this process. Using similar 
proteomics and bioinformatic methods, we 
recently revealed a Rho GTPase signaling network 
that regulates neurite outgrowth (35). This allowed 
us to uncover an unexpected signaling complexity, 
with different Rho GTPase signaling modules 
operating in time and space to regulate distinct 
neurite functions including neurite initiation, 
elongation, pathfinding and filopodial stabilization. 
Similarly, the wide kinase activation and signal 
annotation profiles we observe hint to a high 
degree of modularity in fine tuning neuritogenesis.  
On the other hand, the precise functions of the 
protein kinases that modulate LPA-induced neurite 
collapse were less clear from our 
phosphoproteomic datasets. However one of these 
kinases, Serum- and Glucocorticoid-Inducible 
Kinase 1 (SGK), regulates microtubule 
depolymerization and the shortening of neuronal 
processes (96). It will be important in the future to 
systematically probe these different kinase-
substrate networks to reveal their specialized 
contribution to the dynamic processes of neurite 
growth and retraction.   
Our combined informatics and functional 
studies revealed that integrin to MEK/ERK 
signaling plays a prominent role in controlling 
neuritogenesis.  Based on our findings and the 
work of others we have constructed a working 
model for how MEK/ERK activation and 
deactivation by LPA control neuritogenesis (figure 
6C). The signaling components that were used to 
construct the schematic and their relative 
abundance in the soma and neurite as well as their 
observed phosphorylation sites are listed in figure 
6C and sTable 3. Part (a) shows the proposed 
pathway for how integrins mediate ERK activation 
leading to neurite extension.  ECM proteins like 
laminin and fibronectin are present as adhesive 
gradients in the extracellular environment that can 
initiate and guide neurite protrusion from the cell 
body through activation of integrin receptors and 
the recruitment of their downstream effectors 
including FAK/CAS/Crk (8,83,84). This canonical 
pathway operates spatially in the neurite to drive 
localized Rac activation of PAK. PAK then 
phosphorylates MEK S298 leading to enhanced 
MEK and ERK activity as described in non-
neuronal cells (31-34). The 
integrin/Rac/PAK/MEK-S298 signaling cascade 
promotes strong sustained ERK activation, which 
serves as a switch to mediate neurite outgrowth, 
while suppressing basal RhoA/ROCK/MLC-
mediated membrane contractility, possibly through 
PKA activation (Part b).  
Although the spatial mechanisms that promote 
localized ERK activation in the neurite are not 
clear the integrin/Rac/PAK activation pathway 
most likely works in close conjunction with 
common upstream activators of MEK including 
Rap-1, Ras and Raf (22,97-102). These upstream 
signals fully activate MEK through 
phosphorylation of S218/S222 (103,104). It is 
notable that although MEK activation may occur 
through either B-Raf and/or Raf-1 activation, our 
phosphoproteomics work suggests that B-Raf is 
more likely involved since Raf-1 is highly 
phosphorylated on S43 (growth specific) in 
extending neurites (sTable 1). S43 
phosphorylation has previously been associated 
with PKA activation and is inhibitory to Raf-1 
kinase activity (105,106). How then is B-Raf 
activity modulated to increase MEK/ERK 
signaling? Integrin activation of Rap-1 can 
modulate B-Raf activity as can cAMP/PKA 
signaling (102).  Rap1A and B isoforms are 
present in the neurite and several Rap1 GEF and 
GAP effector proteins are differentially 
phosphorylated during neurite growth and 
retraction (sTable 1).  Rap activity and its effectors 
could be modulated directly or indirectly by 
integrin activation and/or cell spreading on 
laminin, possibly through PKA activation (102).

Alternatively, integrin activation of FAK/Src can 
facilitate activation of the canonical 
Grb2/SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway(22). In 
the end, ERK activity self regulates by modulation 
of its upstream activators through negative 
feedback phosphorylation of MEK-S292, which 
suppresses PAK phosphorylation of 298 and 
phosphorylation of B-Raf-S151, which inhibits B-
Raf activity (102). Part (c) shows a list of 
cytoskeletal effector proteins that are either known 
and/or predicted to be phosphorylated by ERK and, 
thus may modulate neurite growth. Of particular 
interest are α-parvin, which modulates focal 
adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the 
microtubule modulating proteins crmp-1, MARK2, 
MAP1B, and MAP2 (10,107-109). sTable 2 shows 
a  complete list of all identified phosphoproteins 
with ERK consensus phosphorylation signatures.  
An important finding in our study was that 
LPA could disrupt integrin signaling leading to 
blockade of the CAS/Crk/Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK 
pathway (Part a and b). We suspect that this 
facilitates neurite detachment from the ECM by 
losing integrin adhesions to the substratum while 
activating the Rho/ROCK contractile mechanisms 
that physically mediate growth cone collapse and 
membrane retraction through force generation (Fig. 
6C and sFig. 1) (7). Interestingly, the 
RhoA/ROCK/MLC pathway has been reported to 
mediate neurite collapse by modulating collapsin 
response mediator protein (Crmp) family proteins 
and microtubule dynamics (5,108-110).  In our 
work here, Crmp-1 was observed to be enriched 
by 7-fold in the neurite and to be differentially 
phosphorylated on multiple sites in neurites 
undergoing growth or retraction (sTable 1). 
Although the mechanisms that block LPA-induce 
integrin signaling in the neurite are not defined, 
Abl family kinases (Abl and Arg) are likely to 
play a central role through their ability to 
modulate CAS/Crk coupling and Rac activity at 
adhesion sites as described (8,83-85,111-113).   
Importantly, we found that Abl is hypertyrosine 
phosphorylated and enriched by 7-fold in the 
neurite. Also, Abl itself and its known substrates 
c-CrkII-Y221 and LASP-1 show increased 
phosphorylation in the neurite in response to LPA 
(Fig. 4E)(82). This suggests that LPA activates 
Abl kinase which in turn tyrosine phosphorylates 
Crk at Y221 inhibiting CAS/Crk coupling and 
downstream Rac/PAK/MEK activation.  It is also 
notable that LPA did not inhibit MEK-S298 
phosphorylation by PAK in cells expressing 
constitutively activated MEK, which was 
associated with decreased neurite retraction (Fig. 5, 
A and D).  This suggests that MEK/ERK signaling 
provides a positive feedback to maintain 
integrin/CAS/Crk/Rac/PAK signaling and, thus, 
prevent neurite retraction.  
Taken together our work and the work of 
others suggest a model whereby the net effect of 
high Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK activation and RhoA 
inhibition is increased membrane protrusion and 
decreased neurite contraction events leading to net 
neurite growth.  Increased Rac activity has been 
shown to suppress RhoA signaling which leads to 
neurite growth in neurons (7,114).  PKA and ERK 
signaling can also suppress RhoA signaling in 
other cell types (115-117). On the other hand, 
LPA strongly activates RhoA/ROCK/MLC and 
Abl kinase which together mediate neurite 
detachment from the ECM and membrane 
contraction leading to growth cone turning and/or 
collapse.  In this model Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK 
signaling serves as a spatially compartmentalized 
switch that operates downstream of integrin and 
LPA receptor activation to modulate neurite 
growth and retraction kinetics, respectively. Our 
findings provide a plausible mechanism for how 
neuronal growth cones spatially interpret 
extracellular cues and navigate through complex 
tissues, which is critical for proper brain 
development and spinal cord regeneration.

Fig. 1.   Characterization of neurite growth and retraction kinetics using 3.0 μm porous filters and the 
collapsing factor LPA. A. Schematic of a neurite pur ification chamber showing neurite extension toward 
the lower surface of the filter coated with laminin.   B. Left panel, fluorescence photomicrograph of the 
lower surface of the membrane showing neurites stained with α -tubulin (red) extending through 3.0 μm 
pores toward a drop of laminin (green) for 18 hours.  Note that neurites do not extend to the lower surface 
in the absence of laminin coating.  Right panel, fluorescence photomicrograph of a NIE-115 neurite 
growth cone stained with FITC-phalloidin to visualize F-actin (green) and antibodies to tubulin to 
visualize microtubules (red).  Bar, left panel 30 μm, right panel 10 μm.   C.  Quantification of neurite 
extension kinetics to the lower surface of 3.0 μm membranes coated with laminin on the bottom only, top 
only, bottom and top, or not coated with laminin. Neurites were stained with crystal violet; the dye was 
eluted and quantified using a spectrophotometer as described in Experimental Procedures. Standard 
deviations from three independent experiments are shown.  D.  Quantification of neurite retraction 
kinetics in response to LPA added to the lower cham ber (left graph), upper or lower chamber (middle 
graph), or upper and lower chamber (right gra ph) for the indicated times.  E. Fluorescence 
photomicrograph of a time series of neurite retraction on the lower membrane surface in response to LPA 
added to the lower chamber for the indicated times.  Arrow shows retracting neurites.  Bar = 20 μm. 
 
Fig. 2. Canonical pathways that are significantly represented by the identif ied phosphoproteins. 1775 out 
of 1883 identified phosphoproteins were mapped to the IPA database and used for pathways analysis.  78 
pathways have a p-value lower than 0.05 as determ ined by Fishers’s test. Shown are 28 of the most 
significant pathways.  
 
Fig. 3. NetworKIN annotation of kinase substrates in growing and retracting neurites. The identified 
phosphosites in growing and retracting neurites were assigned to their cognate kinase class using the 
NetworkIN software program.  The normalized ra tio of the number of substrates for each kinase was 
calculated and only those that have more than two substrates and with the ratio > 1.5 or < -1.5 were 
shown for comparison.  
 
Fig. 4.  ERK kinase activation mediates NIE-115 neurite  extension. A. Neurons were allowed to extend 
neurites through 3.0 μm pores toward laminin for 12 hours (growth) before LPA was added to the lower 
chamber for the indicated times to induce growth cone  collapse and retraction.  Proteins from somas or 
neurites were then specifically isolated as described in Experimental Procedures and Western blotted with 
phosphosite specific antibodies that recognize the phosph orylated activated form of ERK (P-ERK), or 
MEK (T218, T222, human sequence) or phosphoamino acids S298 and S292 of MEK, which modulate 
kinase activity in response to PAK and ERK kinase activity, respectively.   Western blots of total cell 
ERK/MEK protein are shown for comparison.    B.  Neurites were allowed to extend toward laminin for 
18 hours (time 0) then induced to collapse with LPA  for the indicated times and Western blotted for 
activated ERK-P and total ERK as described in A.  C.  Soma and neurite proteins were prepared as in A 
and Western blotted for the phosphorylated/activated form  of Akt (p-Akt, S473) or total Akt protein.  D. 
Cells were allowed to extend neurites for 18 hours (growth) and then stimulated with LPA to induce 
retraction.  Rac and Cdc42 activati on (Rac-GTP, Cdc42-GTP) were dete rmined from isolated neurite and 
soma proteins using a GST-PBD pulldown assay a nd Western blot analyses. ERK served as loading

control.  E. Cells were allowed to extend neurit es to the lower surface for 8 hours (growth) and then 
stimulated with LPA for the indicated times.  Som as and neurites were purified and Western blotted for 
the indicated proteins and/or specific phosphorylation s ites.  Crk Y221 phosphorylation is detected as a 
decrease in electrophoretic mobility in the gel. LASP-1 was first immunopreci pitated (IP) and then 
Western blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Asterisk indicates the neurite/soma fold enrichment 
of the protein as determined by mass spectrometry a nd or Western blotting and densitometry.  F.  Cells 
were allowed to extend neurites to the lower surface for 8 hours (growth) and then stimulated with LPA 
for the indicated times.  Somas and neurites were pur ified and Western blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine 
antibodies.  Arrows show neurite specific proteins that decrease in response to LPA.  Asterisk shows a 
neurite protein band that does not change in response to LPA.  G. N1E-115 cells were either held in 
suspension (S) or allowed to attach (A) to laminin coated dishes for 45 minutes in the presence or absence 
of LPA and then Western blotted for activated ERK (p-ERK) or MEK S298 as in (A).

of neurite formation of NIE-115 cells either mock tr ansfected or transfected with constructs encoding 
mutationally activated MEK (MEK-CA), or MEK-CA with S298 or S292 amino acids changed to alanine.  
Inset shows the level of MEK expression by Western blot ting.  B. Quantification of neurite formation for 
6 hours in the presence of the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) or the vehicle DMSO (control). 
Inset shows the level of ERK phosphorylation and ki nase activity by Western blotting as described in 
figure 4A.  C. Cells were either mock transfected with a empty vector or transfected with HA tagged 
MEK-CA and allowed to extend neurites to the lower surface for 18 hours and then treated with or 
without LPA for 10 minutes to induce retraction and quantified as described in Figure 1D.   D. Somas and 
neurites were purified from cells transfected as in C and Western blotted with phosphospecific antibodies 
to activated p-ERK and MEK phosphorylated on S292 or S298. HA-MEK and total ERK Western blots 
are shown for comparison.  E. Cells were allowed to extend neurites to the lower membrane surface for 
12 hours then treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 60 minutes (time 0) before being treated with 
or without LPA for the indicated times.  Neurites were quantified as in figure 1D.  
 
Fig. 6. Inhibition of ROCK kinase activity prevents LPA-induce N1E-115 neurite retraction and prevents 
ERK inactivation. A. Neurites were allowed to extend to the lo wer surface of the membrane for 18 hours 
and then treated with or without the ROCK kina se inhibitor Y-27632 for 30 minutes prior to being 
stimulated with or without LPA for 10 minutes.  Neurites were quantified as described in figure 1D.  B.  
Neurites were isolated from cells treated as in A and Western blotted for activated ERK (p-ERK) or 
phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) on serine 19 or total MLC.  C.  Schematic model showing 
the possible signaling and phosphorylation mechanisms that mediate neurite extension and retraction in 
response to the collapsing factor LPA.  Grey shaded circles with black text indicate the phosphorylation 
site and neurite growth/retraction ra tio determined by mass spectrometry.  Red text indicates fold change 
in protein abundance level between soma and neurite.  A list of the depicted proteins and their associated 
regulatory molecules, and their neurite abundance and phosphorylation status are shown in sTable 3 (a) 
shows integrin mediated ERK activation and neurite extension pathway.  (b) shows LPA induced neurite 
retraction pathway.  Also see sFigure 1 for more details of the LPA/Rho pathway. (c) shows cytoskeleton-
associated proteins that contain at least one phosphory lation site that conforms to the ERK amino acid 
consensus sequence Px(S)TP where x is any basic or neutral amino acid.  Numbers in parentheses 
indicate the neurite growth/retraction ratio of the predicated ERK phosphorylation site as measured by 
mass spectrometry. CAS = p130CAS, Crk= C-CrkII, PKA = protein kinase A, FAK = focal adhesion
