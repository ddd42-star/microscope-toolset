Abstract
Living cells utilize signaling pathways to sense, transduce, and process information. As the
extracellular stimulation often has rich temporal characteristics which may govern dynamic
cellular responses, it is important to quantify the rate of information flow through the signal-
ing pathways. In this study, we used an epithelial cell line expressing a light-activatable FGF
receptor and an ERK activity reporter to assess the ability of the MAPK/ERK pathway to
transduce signal encoded in a sequence of pulses. By stimulating the cells with random light
pulse trains, we demonstrated that the MAPK/ERK channel capacity is at least 6 bits per
hour. The input reconstruction algorithm detects the light pulses with 1-min accuracy 5 min
after their occurrence. The high information transmission rate may enable the pathway to
coordinate multiple processes including cell movement and respond to rapidly varying sti-
muli such as chemoattracting gradients created by other cells.
Author summary
To respond to external stimulation, living cells need to transfer information from mem-
brane receptors to downstream proteins that regulate physiological outcomes. In this
study we used cells expressing a light-activatable receptor that transmits signals to MAPK/
ERK transduction pathway, which regulates numerous physiological processes including
proliferation, differentiation and cell motility. By stimulating these cells with various
sequences of short light pulses we found that ERK, the last component of the considered
signal transduction pathway, may receive at least 6 bits per hour. This bitrate allows 6
binary decisions per hour, enabling rapid responses to varied extracellular stimuli.
Introduction
Living cells communicate with each other and constantly monitor their extracellular milieu.
Upon receiving a stimulus, they have to recognize its identity and act accordingly to operate in
a coordinated manner and properly adapt to the changing environment. At the molecular

level, recognition of a specific signal as well as its reliable transmission and appropriate inter-
pretation involve diverse intracellular processes that are notoriously stochastic [1]. At the sin-
gle-cell level, major intracellular signaling pathways respond to an external stimulus in a crude
all-or-nothing manner [2–5]. The inability of individual cells to resolve the level of stimulation
is reflected in the amount of information about the ligand concentration the signaling path-
ways can transmit, which has been estimated to only slightly exceed 1 bit [6–9].
However, when cells are subjected to temporally varying stimulation by morphogens, hor-
mones, or cytokines, it is of interest to quantify the maximum rate at which information can
be transferred through a biochemical signaling pathway. A similar question has been asked
before in the fields of neuroscience and bacteria or amoebae chemotaxis. Neurons utilize pre-
cise timing of spikes to evoke proper response [10–12]. The information transmission rate (or
simply bitrate) through a single neuron may reach tens of bits per second [13,14]. For bacteria
navigating in a chemical gradient, the drift velocity scales linearly with the gradient, while the
bitrate was found to be proportional to the square of the gradient [15]. When concentration
varies on the length scales of millimeters to centimeters, the chemotactic system of E. coli
transfers about 0.01 bit per second, which allows bacteria to climb up the gradient with a few
percent of its swimming speed. This suggests that at low gradients, drift velocity is information
limited [15]. Without explicitly quantifying the information flow, Meier et al. [16] showed that
Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae may synchronously readapt their migration direction to
switching chemotactic gradient oscillating at rates up to 0.02 Hz. This suggests that the rate of
information transmission to the navigation system is up to 1 bit per minute, and the limit is
achieved if all cell decisions are correct. The maximum bitrate depends on biophysics of a spe-
cific information channel. In the case of neurons, where the bitrates are highest, information is
transmitted with the help of fast electro-chemical signals; in the case of E. coli and MAPK,
information is transmitted by means of posttranslational proteins modifications, thus expected
bitrates are lower. The bitrate observed in the E. coli chemotactic system can be higher than
that expected for the MAPK channel, because bacteria are much smaller than a eukaryotic cell.
Some other signaling pathways such, as that of NF-κB or p53, require protein synthesis and
degradation, which are slower than post-translational modifications, and so for these pathways
even lower bitrates are expected.
Gagliardi et al. [17] demonstrated that the ERK pulses triggered locally by growth factors
shed by apoptotic cells coordinate the maintenance of epithelial integrity. In vivo studies
showed pulsatile ERK dynamics during wound healing in mice, wherein the wound edge initi-
ates recurrent, quasiperiodic mechanochemical traveling fronts of ERK activity [18]. Such
waves were also observed during mammalian epidermis development [19] and during scale
regeneration in zebrafish [20]. Pulsatile ERK dynamics has been observed also for tonic EGF
stimulation, for example Albeck et al. [21] and Aoki et al. [22] have shown that the MAPK
pathway converts various types of stimulation into ERK pulses, suggesting their role in gener-
ating physiological outcomes.
In this study, we assessed the capability of the MAPK/ERK pathway to transduce informa-
tion encoded in a sequence of stimulatory pulses, and estimated the lower bound for the rate
of information transmission through this pathway. In light of the mentioned findings, we
focused solely on pulsatile stimulation protocols. As we conjecture that protocols ensuring
highest information transfer are used for cell signaling, we searched for a protocol that would
maximize the information transmission rate, and thus estimated the MAPK/ERK channel
capacity. We considered three different families of pulsatile input protocols: (i) binary encod-
ing, resembling digital communication with zeros and ones occurring in well-defined, tempo-
rally equidistant time slots, is plausibly the simplest pulsatile stimulation protocol; (ii) interval
encoding, with exponentially-distrib uted waiting times in discrete time domain (so, effectively,

geometrically-distributed waiting times), is statistically maximally random (entropic); this pro-
tocol is also natural form the biological perspective as it implies constant propensity of receiv-
ing stimulation pulses in time; (iii) interval encoding with an additional gap after each pulse is
an attempt to tailor a maximally entropic stimulation to cells characterized by an inextricable
refractory (resting) period. We used an epithelial cell line with an optogenetically modified
fibroblast growth factor receptor (optoFGFR) [23,24] which allowed us to stimulate the path-
way with short light pulses activating ERK with the similar kinetics as EGF or FGF [25]. The
cell line is stably transfected with a reporter, enabling fine temporal monitoring of ERK activ-
ity. By stimulating cells with random pulse trains, generated with probabilistic algorithms
according to protocols from the three families, and applying classifier-based algorithm to
reconstruct the stimulatory sequence, we demonstrated that the maximum information trans-
mission rate through the pathway exceeds 6 bits per hour. A classifier-free approach gives an
even higher estimate of about 8.5 bits per hour.
Results
Information encoding and information transmission rate
The maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through a communication
channel per unit time using the best possible input protocol is called the channel capacity C:

where I(S, R) is the mutual information between the input (signal) S and the output (response)
R in an experiment of duration Δt [26]. In this work, we computed I(S, R) as the difference:
I ðS; RÞ ¼ H ðSÞ   H ðSjRÞ ð2Þ
where H(S) is the input entropy (the amount of information sent), which in our experimental
design can be computed directly from the assumed probabilistic distribution of the pathway-
stimulating input sequence; and H(S|R) is the conditional entropy (the amount of information
lost), which captures the uncertainty introduced by the channel (here: the signaling pathway).
The value H(S|R) depends both on the channel and the signal and as such is estimated based
on experimental data.
There are multiple ways to encode information in a train of pulses. When the magnitudes
of all stimulation pulses are equal, the input can be perceived as a sequence of 0s (no pulse)
and 1s (pulse). The input information (or entropy) rate increases with the frequency of pulses,
reaching the maximum for binary sequences that have equal probabilities of 0 and 1. However,
shorter intervals between pulses imply higher information loss due to imperfect transmission.
One should thus expect that there exists an optimum, for which the bitrate is maximal.
We applied three types of pulsatile stimulation protocols to estimate the lower bound for
the channel capacity of the MAPK/ERK pathway (see Fig 1A and Materials and methods
for details). In what we call the binary encoding protocol, information is encoded in a
sequence of 0s and 1s sent at regular time intervals τ
clock
with equal probabilities. In our exper-
iments, we stimulated cells with light pulses according to a 0/1 sequence of length 19:
1011010011110000101 and its logic negation (both of them containing each of the 16 possible
subsequences of length 4 exactly once, which allowed us to collect good statistics in a single,
relatively short experiment). In the interval encoding protocol, information is encoded in the
lengths of intervals between subsequent input light pulses. To maximize the input entropy
(which, in light of Eq (2), bounds the transmitted information from above), the intervals were
drawn from geometric distribution. In the interval encoding protocol with a minimal gap, the

time intervals were also drawn from geometric distribution (with the average inter-pulse inter-
val τ

was added to the drawn value, thus the expected value of the inter-
pulse interval was τ

that maximizes the input entropy
(see Materials and methods for details). Introduction of τ
gap
reduces the input entropy rate
compared to the interval encoding protocols, but increases the percentage of cells evoking a
timely response to a light pulse, which facilitates accurate information transmission.
Detection of pulses
To quantify the bitrate through the MAPK/ERK pathway, we used the human mammary epi-
thelial cell line MCF-10A with both an optogenetically modified fibroblast growth factor
receptor (optoFGFR) [17,25], which can be activated with blue light (470 nm), and a fluores-
cent ERK kinase translocation reporter (ERK KTR), which translocates from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm when phosphorylated by ERK (Fig 1B). The cells were stimulated with short
(100 ms, see Materials and methods) blue light pulses according to the three types of encoding
protocols (Fig 1A). ERK KTR translocation was measured at one-minute resolution (Fig 1C
and 1D; see Materials and methods and S1 Fig for details of the workflow). We observed that
the signal was transduced from optoFGFR to ERK KTR within single minutes, consistently
with Ref. [25], with the steepest translocation increment (drop of the nuclear ERK KTR fluo-
rescence) observed between 2 and 3 min, maximum translocation at 6 min, and steepest trans-
location decrement around 11 min after the light pulse (Fig 1E).
We then employed a classifier based on the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm (see
Materials and methods for details) to reconstruct the sequence of stimulatory light pulses
using the quantified single-cell trajectories of nuclear ERK KTR (Fig 1D). The algorithm was
designed to predict the timing of light pulses using a short (overall, 8 minute-long) window
sliding over the ERK KTR translocation trajectory. The method was typically able to predict
the pulse timing with one-minute resolution (Fig 1F), markedly better than any individual
pulse feature (cf. Fig 1E and 1F). The percentage of detected pulses increases sharply with the
time interval between the pulse to be detected and the previous pulse, reaching about 70% for
the interval of 10 min and nearly 90% for the interval of 15 min (Fig 1G). Missed pulses, pulses
detected as occurring earlier or later (proportion of which is shown in Fig 1G), and false detec-
tions are responsible for the information loss.

Bitrate estimation
We computed the information loss along the pathway as the entropy of the input conditioned
on its (classifier-based) reconstruction from single-cell ERK KTR trajectories, H(S|R). Next, by
subtracting the information loss from the input entropy H(S), we quantified the transmitted
information I(S|R), and eventually, by dividing the result by experiment duration, we esti-
mated the bitrate. It is important to stress that our method of pulse detection is based only on
an 8-min rolling window, hence we do not use prior knowledge about the minimal gap
between pulses.
In Fig 2A we show 10 example single-cell ERK KTR translocation trajectories of cells
responding to the first sequence used in the binary encoding protocol with the time span
between subsequent digits (clock period) τ
clock
= 10 min. The percentage of cells identified as
responding to light pulses varied from around 80% to nearly 100%. As expected, the detectabil-
ity is higher when the time span from the preceding pulse is 20 min or more (more than 95%
pulses are detected). A tiny percentage of cells, � 1%, was incorrectly identified as responding
at time points without a light pulse.
For the binary protocol we performed experiments for 7 different clock periods ranging
from 3 to 30 min (Fig 2B). The input information rate, 1 bit/τ
clock
, decreases with increasing
τ
clock
but, as expected, for longer τ
clock
the fraction of information lost due to missed pulses or
false detections is lower. For the shortest τ
clock
of 3 min, the input information rate reached 20
bit/h, but due to severe information loss the transmitted information rate was lower than for
τ
clock
= 5 min (Fig 2B). It should be noted that in the case of the binary encoding protocol dur-
ing input reconstruction we utilize the a priori knowledge of the time points in which the light
pulses could have occurred (“pulse slots”). Thus, based on the ERK KTR translocation trajec-
tory we have to decide only whether the light pulses occurred in these time points or not. This
makes the reconstruction easier than in the interval encoding protocols, however binary
encoding appears rather artificial in the biological context.
In Fig 2C we show a representative part of ERK KTR translocation trajectories in 10 cells
responding to stimulation with light according to the interval encoding protocol with τ
geom
=
32 min. For all but one input pulse the percentage of cells identified as responding timely
exceeds 75% and is generally higher for pulses occurring after a longer time span from the pre-
vious pulse. For inter-pulse intervals below 10 min, the detectability decreases rapidly (for
example, the pulse at minute 744 that occurred 8 min after its predecessor was detected timely
by only 25% of cells). For each pulse there is also a fraction of detections that indicate an input
pulse 1 min before or after the true pulse.
We performed 6 experiments according to the interval encoding protocol with τ
geom
rang-
ing from 22 to 55 min (Fig 2D). The highest bitrate of 6.3 bit/h was found for τ
geom
36 min,
while for τ
geom
= 32 and 42 min the bitrate was found equal 5.3 and 5.0 bit/h, respectively. The
shortest (22 min) and longest (55 min) average intervals resulted in, respectively, the highest
and the lowest information loss. This causes that for these two suboptimal protocols, having
respectively high (15 bit/h) and low (7.7 bit/h) input information rate, the bitrate is similar,
between 4 and 5 bit/h. The information is lost due to the imprecise detections (that carry
incomplete information about the timing of pulses), missed pulses and false detections (Fig
2D). The estimation of the information loss due to these three types of signal reconstruction
errors is outlined in S2 Fig, panels C–E, and described in Materials and methods.
In Fig 2E, we show 10 example trajectories for the interval encoding protocol with τ
geom
=
10 min and a gap of τ
gap
= 20 min (giving together the mean inter-pulse interval equal 30
min). The ERK KTR translocation pulses are well distinguishable and thus in around 90% of
single-cell trajectories the stimulation pulses were reconstructed with one-minute resolution.

For this protocol the bitrate was found to be the highest, equal 7.0 bit/h based on two experi-
mental replicates (Fig 2F). The somewhat lower bitrate of 6.2 bit/h was found for the protocol
with τ

information is lost due to the three types of errors.

Latency and accuracy of signal detection
In Fig 3A–3C we gathered all the experiments to estimate the maximum bitrate that can be
achieved across all 3 protocols. From 6 to 9 experiments performed for each protocol we
selected 2–4 experiments for which we obtained the highest bitrate, and estimated the lower
bound of the maximum bitrate as the average over these selected experiments. As a result, we
obtained the following bounds (mean ± standard error of the mean):
• 4.1 ± 0.1 bit/h for the binary encoding protocol with the optimal clock period (τ
clock
) in the
range of 5–7 min,
• 5.6 ± 0.4 bit/h for the interval encoding protocol with the optimal average interval (τ
geom
) in
the range of 32–42 min, and
• 6.6 ± 0.3 bit/h for the interval encoding protocol with a minimal gap, with the optimal gap
interval (τ
gap
) in the range of 15–20 min and the (inverse of the) corresponding geometric
distribution parameter (τ
geom
) in the range of 8–10 min.
Altogether, the above results show that the channel capacity of the MAPK/ERK pathway
exceeds 6 bit/h and suggest that the highest bitrate can be achieved for the interval encoding
protocol with a gap.

mum bitrate increases nearly linearly with f, which results from the fact that for short clock
periods lower variability directly corresponds to lower chance of responding to a light pulse.
However, for the interval encoding protocol the most significant increase is observed in the
range 0–20%, which motivated us to remove 20% trajectories. At least some of these trajecto-
ries come from cells with optoFGFR or ERK KTR not functioning properly.
In S3 Fig, panels B–D, we show the histograms of bitrate measured for single cells in all
experiments for the three encoding protocols. The orange area in the histograms corresponds
to the removed 20% fraction of cells. We can notice that the histograms for the interval encod-
ing protocol with a minimal gap are bimodal, but by removing the 20% of cells we may eradi-
cate the lower mode, which additionally justifies the choice of the particular value of f (for
consistency we removed the same fraction of trajectories from experiments for the other two
protocols).
All bitrate estimations are based on the ERK KTR translocation trajectory analyzed in an 8
min-wide rolling window that ends t
D
= 5 min after the hypothetical pulse to be detected (t
D
stands for ‘time to decision’). This means that we account for information that is available for
each cell 5 min after the pulse that the cell is expected to recognize. In Fig 3D we give the maxi-
mal bitrate estimates (for the interval encoding protocol with a minimal gap jointly for the
experiments with the highest bitrate, encircled in Fig 3A–3C) as a function of t
D
. We found
that increasing t
D
beyond 5 min only marginally increases the bitrate, while decreasing it
below 3 min dramatically decreases the bitrate (which possibly reflects the fact that the maxi-
mum increment is usually observed between 2 and 3 min after the pulse).
Reconstruction-free bitrate estimation
An advantage of the reconstruction-based approach is that it enables discerning particular
sources of classification errors (as shown in Fig 2B, 2D and 2F) and provides insight into infor-
mation available to a responding cell. On the other hand, any classifier loses some information
about the responding cell and thus provides a lower bound on the estimate of the cell capability
of transmitting information. Therefore (prompted by an anonymous Reviewer), we performed
a direct (reconstruction-free) estimation of the information transmission rate for both families
of interval encoding protocols. We used the kNN (k = 20) algorithm to estimate the condi-
tional entropy H(S|R), where R is the quantified response, and obtain I(S,R) = H(S) − H(S|R).
Then, by dividing the result by experiment duration, we estimated the bitrate, see Materials
and methods. As in the reconstruction-based approach, we used an 8-min rolling window. As
shown in Fig 4A and 4B, the reconstruction-free estimates are about 2 bit/h higher than those
obtained in the reconstruction-based approach, and equal (mean ± standard error of the
mean):
• 8.2 ± 0.1 bit/h for the interval encoding protocol (based on four data points encircled in Fig
4A) and
• 8.5 ± 0.2 bit/h for the interval encoding protocol with a minimal gap (based on six data
points encircled in Fig 4B).

The largest difference between the reconstruction-based and the reconstruction-free
approach can be observed for data points corresponding to the shortest mean intervals (cf. Figs
3B and 4A). Heuristically, it can be explained as follows: In the reconstruction-bas ed approach,
the small missed pulse errors (occurring for pulses preceded by long intervals) are averaged
with large missed pulse errors (occurring for pulses preceded by short intervals). Thus, for
short mean intervals, the average fidelity of the pulse reconstruction is relatively low which
implies high H(S|R) calculated from the confusion matrix. To illustrate this with a simple
example: when one sends 20 zero-one digits, and the first 10 of them are received with p = 1
confidence, while remaining with p = ½ confidence, then the transmitted information is 10
bits (provided that the receiver knows which bits should be trusted). However, when the
receiver does not know which bits should be trusted, the averaged confidence is p
a
= ¾, which
implies that the transmitted information is 20 (1 –H(S|R)) = 20 (1 + p
a
log
2
(p
a
) + (1 –p
a
) log
2
(1

)) � 3.8 bit. In the reconstruction-free approach the uncertainty about pulses is not
averaged.
Discussion
Toettcher et al. [27] showed that the RAS–ERK module of the MAPK pathway may transmit
input signals across a broad range of timescales, from 4 min to multiple hours. Here, by apply-
ing signal reconstruction-based approach we estimated the information transmission rate
from FGFR to an ERK activity reporter to find that the MAPK/ERK channel capacity exceeds
6 bit/h. In a direct, reconstruction-free approach, we obtained a higher estimate of 8.5 bit/h,
which shows that at the signal reconstruction step a substantial portion of information is lost.
It is debatable, however, whether cells can utilize the input information without “reconstruct-
ing the signal”.
We analyzed three protocols to encode information: binary encoding, interval encoding,
and interval encoding with a minimal gap, to find that interval-encoded information can be
transmitted at a significantly higher bitrate than binary-encoded information. The presence of
a minimal gap between pulses of length comparable to the refractory time (i.e., time in which
the cell may not unambiguously respond to a subsequent pulse) further increases the bitrate
(although this increase is small for the reconstruction-free approach). The lower bound of the
MAPK/ERK channel capacity found in this study is well above our earlier purely theoretical
estimates [28], which suggested a bitrate between 1.4 and 1.9 bit/h. Those MAPK-model esti-
mates were obtained for the binary protocol, but the main source of discrepancy is the longer

refractory time of ~50 min, arising in the computational model [29]. Interval encoding appears
the most natural from the biological perspective as it assumes that pulses occur independently
with some constant intensity (the mean interval is the inverse of the intensity). These random
pulses can be associated with single-cell apoptosis, which recently has been found to trigger
synchronous ERK activation [30] that propagates radially for about three cell “layers” [17].
Using the reconstruction-based approach we found that for the interval encoding with a
minimal gap the bitrate may exceed 6 bit/h, which can be considered as a “safe” lower bound
on the MAPK/ERK channel capacity. The fact that interval encoding is associated with the
highest bitrate follows from the cells’ ability to respond to light pulses in a very synchronous
manner. The light pulses can be detected nearly perfectly with one-minute resolution (pro-
vided that the time from the preceding pulse is longer than the refractory time), based on the
ERK activity in an 8-min interval ending 5 min after the light pulse. Synchronous responses to
the stimuli may enable long-distance waves of ERK activity that assist wound healing, inducing
collective cell migration [18,31]. In our experiments we do not observe communication
between cells, because all cells are illuminated equally and simultaneously. However, when
cells are stimulated in a single spot only, for example due to an apoptotic event, one may
observe propagation of an ERK activity wave outside of this spot [17,32]. This clearly indicates
for cell-to-cell communication and propagation of information. One could expect that even if
such wounding- or apoptosis-generated waves are initiated at small time intervals, the first
“layer” of cells filters out the pulses that occur within the refractory time, and thus the farther
“layers” of cells will be subjected to stimulation that resembles the interval encoding with a
minimal gap.
Since we have not investigated signaling with resolution finer than 1 min we may not rule
out that the MAPK/ERK channel capacity exceeds the determined lower bound of 6 bit/h.
Using finer temporal discretization would increase the entropy of the input, but in the recon-
struction-based approach it would also result in more classification errors, therefore both H(S)
and H(S|R) would be increased. Even for one-minute resolution, a substantial part of informa-
tion loss is due to inaccurate detections (see Fig 2D and 2F).
In our analysis we lumped together responses of different cells. This is known to reduce the
measured information transfer because cell-to-cell differences in responses are treated as
noise. As observed earlier by Toettcher et al. [27], individual cells exhibit precise and reversible
Ras/ERK dose-response behavior; in our case we observe that there are faster and slower cells,
and this causes that we occasionally reconstruct pulses with 1 minute delay or 1 minute in
advance. By learning about each individual cell from its response to first light pulses, one could
use its response to reconstruct subsequent pulses with higher accuracy; such type of analysis
was performed by Selimkhanov et al. [7]. However, when one aims at interpreting transmitted
information as the ability of cells to exhibit synchronous responses to stimuli (required for
ERK activity wave propagation), cell-to-cell differences can be interpreted as an (extrinsic)
noise.
Cells send, receive, and process information, however a natural question is how the infor-
mation transmitted at the rate exceeding 6 bit/h can be utilized. Intuitively, high information
rate is critical when a cell has to respond to constantly changing stimuli. Neurons were shown
to transmit information at rates of tens of bits per second [13,14]. E. coli chemotactic system
transfers about 0.01 bit per second, and this information rate limits its drift velocity in shallow
chemical gradients [15]. Meier et al. [16] showed that D. discoideum (chemotaxis of which is
known to be regulated by an atypical MAP kinase, ERKB [33,34]) may navigate in a switching
chemotactic gradient, changing its direction within a minute. This suggests the information
processing rate of about 1 bit per minute, or less if some cell switch-or-not decisions are
incorrect.

In higher organisms, the MAPK/ERK pathway is known to coordinate diverse complex
behaviors and cell fate decisions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, senes-
cence and apoptosis [35]. The distinction between particular cell fates depends on ERK pulsa-
tile activity integrated over timescales of multiple hours [36]. RAS-to-ERK cascade transmits
signals (and information) from numerous inputs to numerous outputs regulated by ERK and
its upstream components, MEK, RAF, and RAS. During collective cell migration, ERK con-
trols myosin contractile pulses [37]. Spatially localized RAS activation is responsible for forma-
tion of actin-based cell protrusions [38], which arise and contract at the timescale of single
minutes [39], directing cell motion. Since ERK works as a RAS-activated (via RAF and MEK)
RAS inhibitor [40], the ERK activity profile influences cell protrusion and retraction, and thus
cell motion [41]. The high information capacity of the MAPK/ERK channel demonstrated in
this study enables coordination of the versatile functions associated with ERK and its upstream
kinases, with cell motion in response to rapidly changing stimuli likely being the process the
most information is fed into.
Materials and methods
Cell lines
The MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells (derived from an adult female) were a gift of
J.S. Brugge. The cells were modified to stably express the nuclear marker H2B-miRFP703, the
ERK biosensor ERK-KTR-mRuby2 [42] and the optogenetic actuator optoFGFR [23] and used
before in Refs. [17,25].
Cell culture
The modified MCF-10A cells were cultured in tissue-culture treated plastic flasks and fed with
a growth medium composed of DMEM:F12 (1:1) supplemented with horse serum 5%, recom-
binant human EGF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech), L-glutamine, hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma-
Aldrich/Merck), insulin (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), penicillin (200 U/ml) and strepto-
mycin (200 μg/ml). The cells were routinely split upon reaching ~90% confluency. For time-
lapse optogenetic experiments, cells were seeded on 24-well 1.5 glass bottom plates (Cellvis)
coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (PanReac AppliChem) at 1×10
5
cells/well density in growth
medium two days before the experiment. Four hours before the optogenetic stimulation (2.5 h
before imaging), cells were washed twice with PBS and then cultured in a starvation medium
composed of DMEM:F12 (1:1) supplemented with BSA (0.3% Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), L-gluta-
mine, hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich/Merck).
Optogenetic stimulation
OptoFGFR was stimulated with pulses of blue LED light (100 ms, 470 nm, 3 W/cm
2
) applied
according to specific stimulation protocols (see a further subsection on stimulation protocols).
It should be noticed that for short pulses the response depends on the total pulse energy per
unit surface, and that 0.3 J/cm
2
is above the saturation dose [25].
Imaging
Imaging experiments were performed on an epifluorescence Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence
microscope (Nikon) controlled by NIS-Elements (Nikon) with a Plan Apo air 20× (NA 0.8)
objective. Laser-based autofocus was used throughout the experiments. Image acquisition was
performed with an Andor Zyla 4.2 plus camera at the 16-bit depth every 1 min. The following
excitation and emission filters were used: far red: 640 nm, ET705/72m; red: 555 nm, ET652/

60m; green: 470 nm, ET525/36m. Imaging started 1.5 h before the onset of optogenetic stimu-
lation (to provide proper history for ERK KTR track normalization, see a further subsection
on signal processing).
Stimulation protocols
In the case of binary encoding, all stimulation protocols have 19 temporally equidistant pulse
“slots”. We applied the following fixed pattern of pulses: 10110100111100001 01 (1 = pulse,
0 = no pulse), which is the shortest sequence containing uniquely every possible subsequence
of four binary digits. For each “clock period” (i.e., time between pulse slots) this sequence (in
one field of view) and its logic negation (in another field of view) were used. Since the clock
periods ranged from 3 min to 30 min, overall protocol durations ranged from 19×3 = 57 to
19×30 = 570 min. The estimated values of the information transmission rate are means com-
puted for tracks obtained from 2 fields of view and 4–5 biological replicates for each clock
period, except for the clock periods of 20 min and 30 min, for which 10 fields of view from a
single biological replicate were used.
In the case of interval encoding, the inter-pulse intervals were chosen in a randomized
manner: the interval lengths were first selected to best reflect the underlying distribution,
either geometric or geometric with a minimal gap, given the time budget of a single experi-
ment (~26 h), and then randomly shuffled. A four hour-long resting period was added in the
middle of the experiment to allow the cells to regenerate in 3 of 6 experiments with stimulation
according to the protocol without a gap and 5 of 9 experiments with stimulation according to
the protocol with a minimal gap; however, no significant difference was observed between
results of the experiments with and without the resting period. The resting period and the ini-
tial 90-min starvation period were excluded from the analysis. The first pulse of the sequence
and the first pulse after the resting period were also discarded as non-representative. Overall,
in each protocol there were 24–131 analyzed pulses (during 25–31 h) depending on the
assumed average interval between pulses.
Nuclei detection and cell tracking
The nuclei were detected in the channel of fluorescently tagged histone 2B (H2B)-miRFP703
using local thresholding. Outlines of overlapping nuclei were split based on geometric convex-
ity defects when possible. Outlines of nuclei that were partially out of frame were excluded
from analysis. The nuclei were tracked automatically using a greedy algorithm based on
parameters such as proximity of outlines in subsequent time points, their surface area, eccen-
tricity, orientation, total fluorescence intensity and intensity distribution. ERK KTR trajecto-
ries were obtained by calculating within each tracked nuclear outline the mean intensity in the
ERK KTR channel. All image processing was performed within our custom software,
S HUTTLE T RACKER .
Signal processing
For each tracked nucleus, the mean ERK KTR intensity in its contour was quantified and nor-
malized, first with the whole-image mean intensity in the ERK KTR channel (to compensate
for possible global changes in fluorescence), and then with the average over the cell 120-min
history (to account for variation in ERK KTR expression or its uneven visibility in individual
cells). Such normalized values were subtracted from 1 and then referred to simply as ‘ERK
KTR translocation’ and denoted x
t
, where t indicates a time point and directly corresponds to
the minute of the imaged part of the experiment. Of note, for nuclear ERK KTR signal con-
stant in time, such normalization and linear transformation would imply x
t
= 0.

Selection of tracks
In each field of view, we ranked tracks by their length and then by their quality, defined as low
variation of the nuclear area within the track, and preselected 500 top scoring tracks. To elimi-
nate cells that responded weakly to stimulation, for example due to low reporter expression,
we further rejected 100 tracks (20%) with the lowest sum-of-squares of the discrete derivative
of the ERK KTR translocation trajectory (computed after only the first step of normalization).
Input reconstruction
Binary encoding. For each experiment, 200 out of the 400 ERK KTR translocation trajec-
tories were randomly selected as a train set, and 200 trajectories from cells stimulated with the
negated sequence as the test set. For each potential light pulse time point t
0
, referred to as
“slot”, we extracted slices of ℓ = 6 subsequent time points beginning at three different shifts
with respect to t
0
: 2 min before the slot (that is, from t
0
− 2 to t
0
+ 3), 1 min before the slot
(from t
0
− 1 to t
0
+ 4), and exactly on the time point of the slot (from t
0
to t
0
+ 5). For each slice
we computed ℓ − 1 discrete backward derivatives, Δx
t
= x
t
− x
t−1
. Separately for each of the
three sets of slices (corresponding to a specific shift with respect to t
0
), a kNN (k = 20) classifier
[43] with (ℓ − 1)-dimensional Euclidean distance was trained and evaluated so that each slice
in the test set was labeled with 0/1 depending on the predicted occurrence of a light pulse in its
slot. In this way, three 0/1 labels were assigned to a single slot. To obtain input signal recon-
struction in each slot of x
t
, an ensemble classifier combined three binary predictions through
hard voting, i.e., pulse is confirmed if two or three predictions are ‘yes’. In the estimation of
the confusion matrix (described further), the whole procedure was repeated for 10 random
resamplings of the training set and the test set. We checked that the reconstruction is not
improved for higher k.
Interval encoding. The ERK KTR translocation trajectories from each experiment were
split into the training set (200 randomly selected trajectories) and the test set (200 remaining
trajectories). Each trajectory was represented as a set of overlapping slices of ℓ = 6 subsequent
time points. The slices constitute a perfect 6-fold coverage meaning that each (non-terminal)
time point belongs to 6 (partially overlapping) slices. Each slice was labeled with the “time
after pulse” (TAP) being the time from the last light pulse to the last time point of the slice (or
from the previous pulse if this time is shorter than 3 min); this adjustment is important in the
case of very short, 3–4 min, inter-pulse intervals). For each slice we computed ℓ − 1 discrete
backward derivatives, Δx
t
= x
t
− x
t−1
. A kNN (k = 20) classifier [43] with (ℓ − 1)-dimensional
Euclidean distance was trained to predict a TAP associated with each slice. Slices with TAP val-
ues of 3, 4, or 5 min were used to predict pulses through hard voting: time points indicated by
at least two of three slices were considered as time points having a light pulse in the final recon-
struction (see S2 Fig, panels A and B). To additionally prevent a single pulse from being pre-
dicted multiple times, if more than one prediction was indicated within any three subsequent
time points, all predictions except the first one were discarded. In the estimation of the contin-
gency table (described further), the whole procedure was repeated for 10 different random par-
titionings of trajectories into the test set and the train set.
Let us notice that in both the binary and the interval encoding protocols, the decision
whether to classify a given time point t
0
as a point containing a light pulse was made based on
3 subsequent, partially overlapping slices of length 6, which cover 8 subsequent values of x
t
(for t ranging from t
0
− 2 to t
0
+ 5). Thus, only information available to a cell 5 min after the
pulse was used by the trained ensemble classifier to make a prediction. In Fig 3D and 3E, the
length of this window is varied to check how fast information is accumulated.

Bitrate computation
We estimated the bitrate as the amount of information I(S, R) between the input signal S and

where H(S) is the entropy of an input signal and H(S|R) is the entropy of the input conditioned
on the response in the case of reconstruction-free approach or on the output-based reconstruc-
tion of the input in the case of reconstruction-based approach. As described below, the input
entropy rate, h(S) ≔ H(S)/Δt, may be determined theoretically, whereas the conditional
entropy H(S|R) is calculated based on ERK KTR translocation trajectories.
Input entropy rate
In the case of the binary encoding protocol, input sequences contain 0/1 digits occurring inde-
pendently with identical probabilities of ½ in temporally equidistant pulse slots. The entropy
of such 19-digit input sequences is H
binary
(S) = 19 bits. When digits occur in pulse slots τ

Since τ

is the clock period of the binary encoding protocol, Eq (4) expresses the input
entropy rate per clock period.
In the case of the interval encoding protocols, intervals between pulses are drawn at random
from the geometric distribution with the rate parameter p = 1/τ

and are optionally length-
ened by adding τ

per digit. For the interval encoding protocol (nominally without a minimal gap), τ

Conditional entropy—Reconstruction-ba sed approach
For the binary and the interval encoding protocols, we estimate from above the conditional
entropy H(S|R) per digit of the input given its reconstruction (throughout this section, R
denotes input reconstruction). In light of Eq (3) this will provide us with a lower bound on the
bitrate i(S, R). Entropy of a joint distribution is lower than the sum of individual entropies

To summarize, bitrate may be computed based on Eq (3) with input entropy rates given by
Eqs (4) and (6) and conditional entropies given by Eqs (12) and (14) in the case of the binary
encoding protocols and in the case of interval encoding protocols, respectively.
Reconstruction-ba sed approach—Sourc es of information loss
To determine the sources of the information loss (Fig 2B, 2D and 2F), we sequentially cor-
rected all types of errors in the reconstruction: false detections (false positives), missed pulses
(false negatives), and for the interval encoding protocols also inaccurate (deferred or
advanced) detections. After each correction step, we recomputed the confusion matrix/contin-
gency table and attributed the decrease of conditional entropy and the resulting increases of
bitrate to the particular type of error. Since the obtained results depend on a particular order
of correction steps, to compare individual contributions from the three corresponding types of
reconstruction errors, we calculated each of these contributions by averaging over all possible
orders of the correction steps (2 permutations for the binary encoding protocol; 6 permuta-
tions for the interval encoding protocols; see S2 Fig, panels C–E). Of note, each sequence of
correction steps restores exactly the input signal and the estimated bitrate losses associated
with considered error types sum up to the total bitrate loss. Since the procedure is symmetric
with respect to each type of error, these contributions may be compared.
Conditional entropy—Reconstruction-fr ee approach
To estimate the information transmission rate directly, i.e., without the reconstruction step
(Fig 4), we split the trajectories into slices of length ℓ = 8 as described above and labeled them
with 0/1 depending on whether an input pulse occurred at the time point 5 min before the last
time point in the slice. The slice length ℓ = 8 was chosen to comply with the reconstruction-
based approach, where we used three consecutive slices of length 6 that jointly span over an
interval of 8 time points. Seven (= ℓ−1) finite differences were computed for each slice, r,
embedding all slices in the 7-dimensional Euclidian space. For each r, k = 20 nearest neighbors
were found (including the slice itself) and the numbers n
0
and n
1
of neighbors marked with 0
and 1, respectively, were counted (n
0
+ n
1
= k). For each slice, the conditional entropy was

are non-zero, and 0 oth-
erwise [45,46]. The overall conditional entropy H(S|R) was estimated by averaging H(S|r) over
all slices r. The procedure was performed on 200 trajectories randomly chosen out of 400 cell
trajectories in each experiment, and repeated 10 times for different choices to evaluate the
robustness of the estimate.

S2 Fig. Interval encoding: Input sequence reconstruction algorithm and determination of
the sources of information loss (reconstruction-based approach). (A) Tracks from the train-
ing set are segmented into overlapping slices of 6 consecutive time points such that each time
point belongs to 6 slices. Each slice is labeled with the time after pulse (TAP), measured with
respect to the last time point in the slice. The kNN classifier is trained to predict the TAP based
on 5 discrete differences between 6 consecutive time points of a slice. (B) For each slice, the
TAP predicted by the classifier indicates a time point at which the stimulation pulse could
occur. Votes for particular time points from different slices are counted. Only votes from slices
predicted with TAP = 3,4,5 min are taken into account, the remaining are ignored as unreli-
able. Time points that received at least two out of the three possible votes are considered as
time points with pulse in the final reconstruction, R. (C) Detection and labeling of errors in
the reconstruction R. Inaccurate detections (one minute before or after the pulse) are not
decomposed into missed pulses and false detections but assigned to their specific error types.
Since the patterns ‘11’ and ‘101’ are guaranteed never to occur in the input sequence S, the
error classification is unambiguous. (D) An example 3-step sequence of error corrections for
the interval encoding protocols. After the third step, the fully corrected reconstruction R

is
identical to the input sequence S. The difference between bitrate before and after each correc-
tion step is attributed to the particular information loss source. (E) As the difference in bitrate
depends on the sequence of corrections, the contributions of the three types of errors are aver-
aged over all permutations of correction steps.

preselection step. The (lower bound for) bitrate is computed as in Fig 3. Error bars denote
standard error of the mean based on the 2–4 experiments with highest bitrate. In the preselec-
tion step we aim at excluding cells that do not respond to stimulation, possibly due to low
expression of optoFGFR or ERK KTR. The rejection criterion is formulated in a way a priori
independent of the accuracy of pulse detection, see Methods for details. Throughout the paper,
the fraction of rejected cells is set to 20% (highlighted in gray), because above this value the
bitrate estimates in the interval encoding protocols (with and without minimal gap) reach a
plateau. (B, C, D) Histograms of the information transmission rates in single cells for (B)
