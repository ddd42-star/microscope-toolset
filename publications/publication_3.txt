Summary  
Collection of myosin motors and actin filaments can self -assemble into submicrometric 
clusters under the regulation of Rho A. Emergent dynamics of these clusters have been 
reported in a variety of morphogenetic systems, ranging from Drosophila to acto -myosin 
assays in vitro. In single cell cytokinetic rings, acto -myosin clusters are associated with stress 
generation when radial and transport when tangential with respect to the ring closure. Here, 
we show that these phenomena hold true for acto -myosin multi-cellular rings during wound 
closure in epithelial monolayers. We assessed the activity of RhoA using FRET sensors, and we 
report that cluster dynamics does not correlate with RhoA activity. Nevertheless, we show 
that bursts of RhoA activation precede recruitment of myosin . Altogether myosin clusters 
dynamics is conserved between single and multi-cellular systems and this suggests that they 
could be used as generic read -outs for mapping and predicting stress generation and shape 
changes in morphogenesis. 
 
Introduction  
Morphogenesis follows a highly dynamic orchestration of cellular phenomena  (Collinet and 
Lecuit, 2021; Heisenberg and Bella ïche, 2013). Cells modify their shapes, divide, delaminate 
and change their localisations with their neighbours. These transformations in multi -cellular 
systems have been the focus of recent studies at the interfaces between Physics and Biology. 
Generic rules for self-organisation are expected to emerge by studying and comparing similar 
shape transformations in different biological systems. 
The acto-myosin cytoskeleton is a key player in shape transformations within multi -cellular 
systems (Blanchoin et al., 2014; Samandar Eweis and Plastino, 2020; Sekino et al., 2007). Acto-
myosin is composed of arrays of myosin II motors interacting with actin filaments (Koenderink 
and Paluch, 2018). This network of acto-myosin, which contracts and expands, based on the 
position and orientation of actin filaments and myosin motors (Svitkina, 2018). Acto-myosin 
networks can organize in different architectures, playing different roles in cell and tissue 
dynamics (Blanchoin et al., 2014) . Also the small RhoA GTPase regulates activity of myosin

through signalling pathways well documented  as well as with their GEF/GAP regulatory 
switches (Agarwal and Zaidel -Bar, 2019; Molnar and Labouesse, 2021) . Their dynamics and 
their connections to myosin activities are important and they can mediate changes in shapes 
of the cytoskeleton and cell shapes (Koenderink and Paluch, 2018). 
To predict mesoscopic outcomes from the cytoskeleton organization, molecular composition 
information is not sufficient, because thousands of individual molecules interacting together 
result in collective behaviour  (Wollrab et al., 2016)  which do not result from the simple 
addition of individual behaviours . Also, acto -myosin network architectures are often not 
known and they can be diverse for different in vivo systems (Koenderink and Paluch, 2018). 
In mammalian and fission yeast cells, the dynamic s of long-lived myosin clusters measuring 
roughly 200 nm in size was shown to be a readout fully capturing the contraction of the acto-
myosin ring (Wollrab et al., 2016) . Ring constriction showed two different types of cluster 
dynamics where myosin clusters were observed to be rotating clockwise and counter -
clockwise in the case of fission yeast rings at a velocity of 2 µm/min, whereas they remained 
still within the ring framework in the case of mammalian cells. Theory and experiments using 
specific inhibitors associated rotating clusters with transport of the wall machinery for fission 
yeast, and still clusters to stress generation and constriction of the ring in mammalia n cells. 
These rules should also be relevant for other acto-myosin systems found in other situations. 
In particular, rings in multicellular system as well  are expected to show these clusters 
dynamics with a similar outcome, according to the genericity of associated theoretical 
framework for active fluids (Prost et al., 2015).  
In this context, we evaluate the dynamics of self -organised myosin clusters in an epitheli al 
monolayer. To test whether the dynamics of myosin clusters in multicellular systems is similar 
to their dynamics in single/isolated cells , we generated controlled acto -myosin wound rings 
in epithelial monolayers (Anon et al., 2012; Vedula et al., 2014) , a geometry that allows 
comparison with the cytokinetic ring in single cells. Two classes of cluster dynamics, still and 
rotating, are associated with stress generation and transport respectively. We compared both 
dynamics throughout different configurations and we made correlations with the associated 
RhoA activity.  Although RhoA activity correlates with cluster self -assembly, there is no  
relationship between cluster behaviours and RhoA levels.  Finally, we propose that spatio -
temporal dynamics of acto-myosin clusters could be used as a readout for stress generation 
in tissues. 
 
Results 
Velocity of wound closure is independent of cell number around the wound 
To generate wounds, we attached micro -pillars on a substrate and seeded cells in -between. 
Removal of the micro -pillars generated holes in an epithelial monolayer  which eventually 
closed through the assembly of an acto -myosin ring at the frontier region  (Fig. 1A, S1A, and 
S2A, see Material and Methods for details). The ring diameter was fixed to 50 µm to rule out 
closure driven by lamellipodia growth (Vedula et al., 2014) . We then tracked wound closure 
and myosin cluster dynamics over time. The velocity of wound closure was constant over the 
first 100 minutes (Fig. S2B), and the wound then completed closure over 400 minutes. 
To address the contribution of cell number during wound closure, two different approaches 
were taken: (i) variation of inter -distance between pillars, introducing different number s of 
cells between rings (Fig. S2A (i -iii), Movie 1); (ii) wound closure of a doughnut shape ring to 
rule out the contribution of cells away from the ring to the closur e (Fig. S2A’(i -ii) and S1B (i -
v)). We measured the different dynamics corresponding to each situation (Fig. S2B and S2C).

Velocities and dynamics were similar across configurations, suggesting that cells between 
rings do not play a key role in closure. This suggests that the ring, and not the surrounding 
tissue, is the main stress generator during closure.  
 
Myosin density in the ring is constant over time during wound closure 
Next, we looked at acto-myosin around the wound edge. Specifically, we looked at the acto-
myosin cable which surrounds the epithelial edge as a continuous structure containing 1.8 to 
2 times higher myosin levels than the epithelium base level (Fig. S3A (i)). We measured myosin 
levels in the cable with time: the total myosin intensity was shown to decrease during 
constriction, keeping the concentration (mean intensity) constant (Fig. S3A (ii)). To test 
whether the abundance of myosin in the whole cell or only along the cable decrease, we also 
measured the total amount of myosin in cells contributing to the cable (Fig. S3B). We find that 
the total amount of myosin in a cell is constant on the time scale of wound healing, but re -
localized to maintain a constant concentration in the cable with a high turnover evaluated by 
fluorescence after photobleaching experiment (Fig. S3C, Materials and Methods) . We 
measured the distance from the acto -myosin cable to the substrate by correlative light 
electron microscopy (CLEM) to be within 0.9-1 µm. In the same experiment, we measured the 
thickness of the acto -myosin cable t o be 0.5 µm (Fig. S 4, Movie S8 and S9). Altogether, the 
ring constricts with constant acto-myosin density in the cable leading to wound closure. 
 
Myosin self -organizes in clusters within the acto -myosin cable and exhibit s two types of 
dynamics 
We observe myosin clusters  along every wound ring perimeter  (Fig. 1B). In general, we 
observe 3 to 4 clusters per ring  for typically 6 cells  with constant myosin concentration and 
density on the cable (Fig. S5A and Fig. S5B). Clusters can move along the cable but do not cross 
cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1 C). To gain h igher resolution images we imaged these clusters with 
stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and CLEM and measured 500 nm for clusters 
dimension (Fig. 1E), a size which is consistent with previous work in the context of cytokinesis 
(Wollrab et al., 2016). 
We observed cluster dynamics, and categorized them in two types (Fig. 1 B and 1D). Clusters 
with a constant angular position as the cable constricts are named radial clusters. Conversely, 
clusters with angular motion along the cable perimeter are named tangential clusters (Fig. 1B 
and Movie S2). Cables could present simultaneously radial and tangential clusters.  We 
observed rare occurrences of myosin clusters transitioning from one dynamic to the other, 
but most did not. The typical velocity of radial and tangential clusters was evaluated to be 0.05 
µm/min and 0.2 µm/min respectively (Figure S5C (ii)).  
 
Radial clusters drive fast wound closure 
To test whether the dynamics of clusters could be correlated to wound closure, we plotted 
the constriction velocity as a function of tangential and radial cluster fraction (Fig. 1 D). We 
saw a strong correlation: faster constrictions correlated with higher fraction of radial clusters 
(Fig. 1D and Figure S6 Pearson’s R=0.80). We propose that radial clusters are associated with 
stress generation. 
To test whether we could control the dynamics of clusters externally, we left PDMS micro -
pillars inside the cell monolayer as a physical barrier to prevent wound closure (illustration 
Fig. 2A, Fig. 2B, Movie S6). As expected, we did not observe closure. Surprisingly, all clusters

moved around the ring with a tangential dynamic (kymograph Fig. 2C, Fig. 2F). This consistent 
with the trend of Fig. 1D, as all clusters are tangential when the closure is stalled.  
To rule out the potential contribution of cell motion to cluster dynamics, we measured 
positions of myosin clusters with respect to the associated cell edge (Fig. S 7A). This analysis 
revealed that movement of myosin clusters occurs within the cable independently of the rest 
of the cell (Fig. S7B and Fig. S7C). Altogether, cluster dynamics correlate with wound closure 
dynamics. 
 
Radial clusters generate more stress than tangential clusters in the acto-myosin cable 
We used laser ablation to evaluate the stress associated with radial and tangential clusters. 
Upon ablation, wound constriction stalls and the ring immediately opens, showing that the 
cable is under tension (Fig. 1F, 1G). Ablation of radial clusters leads on average to an initial 
retraction velocity 1.6 times larger than of the ones measured for tangential clusters (Fig. 1H, 
Movie S4 and S5 ). Retraction velocities corresponding to radial and tangential clusters were 
evaluated to be 6.2 ± 0.6 µm/s and 3.9 ± 0.4 µm/s respectively (Mean ± SEM, Fig.  1H, 19 
clusters, Mann -Whitney U test’s p -value=0.012). Assuming that viscous friction within the 
acto-myosin gel is the same throughout the cable, we interpret changes in retraction velocity 
as changes in tension (Mayer et al., 2010) . These results indicate that radial clusters have 
higher tension associated with them compared to tangential clusters. 
 
Myosin activity in clusters is responsible for stress generation 
To test the contribution of myosin clusters to stress generation, we used the potent reversible 
myosin light chain kinase inhibitor drug ML -7 (Watanabe et al., 2007) . Exposing the acto -
myosin rings to the kinase inhibitor led to the disappearance of myosin clusters and the acto-
myosin ring (Fig. 2D). This disappearance was simultaneous with an increase in ring diameter 
(Fig. 2E). After washout of the kinase inhibitor, acto -myosin structures reappeared and the 
cable restarted constriction (Fig. 2D). This demonstrates myosin activity is necessary and 
sufficient for ring constriction and the formation of myosin clusters (radial as well as 
tangential). In addition, disappearance and reappear ance of clusters upon inhibition and 
reactivation of the kinase support additional evidence regarding the self -organized nature of 
myosin clusters. Similarly, the kinase inhibitor was used in a configuration with pillars left 
inside the monolayer (Fig. 2F). In this configuration, wounds do not close and clusters are all 
tangential. Surprisingly, d uring drug exposure t hese cluster s did not disappear and the 
tangential dynamic was unaffected in contrast to control condition (compare Fig. 2D and Fig. 
2F), suggesting a mechanosensing response of myosin clusters in the presence of a physical 
barrier.  
 
Cluster types are independent of RhoA activity 
Local transient increase of RhoA activity has been reported to occur in response to wounds in 
single cells as well as multicellular systems (Simon et al., 2013; Tamada et al., 2007; Wagner 
and Glotzer, 2016) . To assess involvement of the RhoA pathway and its spatio -temporal 
activity throughout the acto-myosin wound ring, we mapped RhoA activity with FRET sensors 
(Fig. 3A and Fig. S8) (Pertz, 2010). The highest RhoA activity is found at the wound boundary 
where the acto -myosin cable is assembled (Fig. 3B, 3C). Upon laser ablation, an increase in 
RhoA activity precedes myosin recruitment by 4 ± 2 min (Mean ± SEM, Fig. 3C, 3E, Movie 7). 
To test the correlation between RhoA activity and cluster dynamics, we measured myosin 
density and RhoA activity along the rings. We grouped RhoA activity measurements to the

type of clusters (Fig. 3D). We found that increased RhoA activity in rings correlates with 
increased myosin concentration for low values of myosin concentration, and thus we observe 
higher RhoA activity in clusters than in the acto-myosin cable. Nevertheless, all clusters - radial 
and tangential - share similar levels of high RhoA activity (Fig. 3D). This suggests that cluster 
dynamics do not depend on RhoA levels, but possibly emerge through self-organisation of the 
myosin lattice in response to different forces downstream of RhoA-ROCK-MLC signaling. 
 
Discussion 
In this study, we report that acto -myosin clusters self -organize in multicellular systems and 
exhibit properties similar to clusters in cytokinetic rings. Radial clusters correlate with faster 
closure and generate higher stress in contrast to tangential clusters, as shown by our laser 
ablation experiments. RhoA activity is high within the acto -myosin cable and constant in 
clusters. This suggests that clusters can self-organize as an active gel with no regulation, as 
suggested by previous theoretical work (Levernier and Kruse, 2020).  
 
It is interesting to note that myosin clusters are reported in a variety of model systems in vivo. 
They exhibit similar dynamics as the clusters we report. In Drosophila, myosin clusters 
undergo oscillations similar to our radial clusters and this dynamic s is associated with 
deformation of amnioserosa cells (Rauzi et al., 2010) . In Zebrafish and mice, continuous 
motion of myosin clusters is related to tissue flow (Baird et al., 2017; Behrndt et al., 2012) . 
This also resembles self-organised clusters also reported in in vitro assays with purified actin 
associated proteins (Reymann et al., 2012). 
Cluster dynamics could serve as a readout for force generation in the developing embryo 
(Rauzi et al., 2010) . Combining cluster readout  and their tracking over time  with cell shape 
would bring a local fiducial marker to map fluctuations in shapes and in tissue dynamics. An 
analysis pipeline could map in space and time the clusters dynamics. Their trajectories would 
be converted into stress generation with potential predictive power for morphogenetic 
events. 
In this context it is worth noting that such active gels in the vicinity of a membrane can produce 
chaotic dynamics (Levernier and Kruse, 2020). This resembles closely the continuous back and 
forth movement of clusters when the ring is constrained by a fixed pillar. We propose that 
radial clusters are associated to stress generation perpendicular to the interface when pillars 
are removed. It would be interesting to measure tangential and ra dial stresses by using 
deformable pillars with controlled elasticity to support this framework. 
 
The persistence of clusters during ML7 incubation with pillars inside the tissue was not 
expected since myosin clusters disappeared in the absence of pillars. This calls for a potential 
mechanosensory mechanism. Along the idea of radial and tangential stre ss generation, we 
propose that myosin clusters submitted to the resisting force of the pillar could compensate 
for the expected effect of the inhibitor and still undergo motion. It would be interesting to 
test this mechanism by quantifying the phosphorylat ion of myosin in live experiments to 
determine the relevance of our hypothesis. 
 
Our results also show that RhoA can mechanosense the wound to get activated and increase 
ROCK-MLC signaling. Self -organisation of myosin yields the clusters dynamics in contrast to  
RhoA spatially regulating the myosin arrays. This is understandable since RhoA is a lipidated 
molecule (geranyl geranylated), and thus diffuse in the plasma membrane. This explains why

a RhoA activity appears to be higher on average around the cable. However myosin clusters 
whether radial or tangential exhibit the same RhoA activity. As a result, we propose that both 
dynamics are controlled by  generic properties of acto -myosin interacting systems, well 
captured by the formalism of pure active gels without regulation. 
 
Altogether, the physics of force generation by myosin clusters appears to be conserved in 
cytokinesis and in wound closure in multicellular system . But this dynamic  appears to be 
conserved also in larger scales. It was reported (Palmquist et al., 2022) that multicellular rings 
exhibit dynamic of cell clustering which is very reminiscent of our observations, three orders 
of magnitude higher in dimension than our myosin clusters. Specifically, groups of cells within 
a ring appeared to exhibit collective contraction and flows. This suggests that the specificities 
of each contractile systems are not essential. C ontinuous contractile acto-myosin systems  
leading to local force dipoles share generic behaviours, from the cytokinetic ring of single cells 
to a col lection of epithelial contractile cells . This invariance in scale is consistent with the 
genericity of active matter theory (Marchetti et al., 2013). It will be interesting to further test 
myosin clusters dynamics across scales to characterize morphogenetic events.

Material and Methods 
Cell lines and culture conditions 
We used the following Madin -Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK II) cell lines in this study: MDCK 
wild-type cells expressing wild type Myosin Regulatory Light Chain (MRLC) fused to GFP 
(MRLC::GFP) and cells co -expressing MRLC fused to Kosabira Orange (MRLC::KO1) and E -
cadherin fused to Neon -Green (Ecad::mNG).  Cells were cultured a t 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 in 
DMEM (1 g/L) with 10 % Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS HyClone 10309433) and 1 % penicillin -
streptomycin (Gibco 11548876) . For imaging, we used L -15 medium (Invitrogen) 
supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin -streptomycin. For experiments with myosin 
inhibitors, we used ML-7 (#I2764, Sigma) at a concentration of 40 µM.  
 
Microfabrication and cell plating: 
The protocol was adapted from (Vedula et al., 2014) . Briefly, SU-8 pillars with a diameter of 
50 µm and height of 80 µm were micro -fabricated on silicon wafers using UV 
photolithography. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS:cross-linker with a ratio of 9:1) was poured on 
the silicon wafer with 3D patterns and left at 65 °C overnight for curing. The PDMS block with 
pillars was bonded to the glass coverslip using oxygen plasma, and the assembly was left at 
room temperature for 40 to 60 minutes. Next, to avoid attachment of cells to the PDMS pillars, 
the sample was incubated with Pluronic acid (0.2 % in double distilled water) for 40 to 60 
minutes for passivation. Then the liquid was removed and the sample was left to dry. Next, 
cells were plated at a concentration of 21000 cells/µl inside the sample by inoculating 20 µL 
of cell suspension close to the entry point below the PDMS. Cells entered by capillarity and 
the available volume was completed with serum containing media. The sample was incubated 
at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 for 14 to 15 hours. Unless otherwise mentioned in the main text, after 
cells spread evenly around the motifs, the PDMS block was carefully removed leaving 
controlled wounds in the monolayer.  
 
Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) 
MDCK cells were cultured on laser micro -patterned Aclar support  (Lenormand et al., 2013; 
Spiegelhalter et al., 2010). Fluorescent microscopy images were first acquired on an inverted 
Leica confocal microscope (SP5) equipped with a Z -galvo stage with temperature control 
(whole microscope). A standard or resonant scanner (8000 Hz, 8000 lines/s) was used for fast 
imaging. DPSS 561 (561 nm, 10 %) and argon (488 nm, 10 %) laser were used for excitation of 
cells expressing, MRLC -KO1 and Ecad -mNG respectively. CX PL APO 40x/1.25 -0.75 OIL 
objective was used for acquisition. The acquisition was done with photomultiplier tube (PMT) 
detectors at an interval of 1 min. Acquisition was followed immediately by fixation of cells and 
fragments using 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% formaldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 2 
hour at 4 C. After washing, the samples were post -fixed for 1 hour in 1% osmium tetroxide 
[OsO4] reduced by 0.8% potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) [K3Fe(CN)6] in H2O at +4°C. After 
extensive rinses in distilled water, samples were then post -stained by 1% uranyl aceta te for 
over-night at +4°C, and rinsed in water. Samples wer e dehydrated with increasing 
concentrations of ethanol and embedded with a graded series of epon 812 resin. Samples 
were finally polymerized at 60°C for 48 hours. Ultrathin serials sections (80nm) were picked 
up on 1% pioloform coated copper slot grids and examined using a Philips CM12 TEM electron 
microscope (Philips, FEI Electron Optics, Eindhoven, Netherlands) operated at 80kV and 
equipped with an Orius 1000 CDD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, USA).

Optical setups for imaging of wound rings 
For acquiring temporal dynamics in multicellular rings for phase contrast and fluorescence 
imaging, epifluorescence inverted Olympus CKX41 setups were used. All the microscope 
setups were enclosed inside a temperature -controlled chamber stably maintained a t 37 °C. 
The samples were mounted either on a Marzhauser stage with a stepper motor or with Tango 
controller, enabling multi -position acquisitions. The optical path to the samples was 
controlled with the help of shutters by (Uniblitz VCM -D1/ VMM -D1 or Thor Labs SC10) to 
prevent phototoxicity in case of continuous exposure. A fluorescence excitation lamp (Leica 
E6000) with mercury metal halide bulb and a white light delivery optical fiber was used, with 
a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CCD, Hamamatsu C4 742-95 / C8484-03G02). White 
light was used in coordination with filters corresponding to the required acquisition channel. 
The devices were controlled by custom -made scripts in the interface of the micromanager 
software. The objectives were selected based  on the required field of view and structure 
resolution. For ring closure experiments Olympus phase contrast air objectives 20X (N.A 0.4) 
or 40X (N.A 0.9) were used. The acquisition was done with 500 ms exposure and a 1 min frame 
interval to capture the temporal dynamics. To prevent evaporation of the media, the samples 
were covered with clean plastic lids, and the incubation chamber was maintained humid by 
constant storage of water inside the temperature-controlled microscope setup. 
 
Laser ablation and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching 
Laser ablation experiments were performed using a TCS SP5 inverted microscope setup with 
a temperature-controlled chamber and a z-galvo stage. A pulsed multi photon laser (Coherent 
chameleon Ultra II; 800 nm; 4 MW) was used in synchrony with the TCS SP5 FR AP module. 
Pre- and post- ablation, the frame interval was set to 1.2 s. FRAP experiments were performed 
using a confocal spinning disk microscope (Nikon; Yokogawa CSU-X1 Confocal Scanner; Roper 
iLas FRAP system) for high -speed multi-dimensional acquisition. The objective was 100X Oil 
APO N.A 1.49. Bleaching was achieved using a visible light laser (561 nm) and the recovery was 
acquired using both 488 nm and 561 nm laser lines to image E-cadherin::mNG and MRLC::KO1 
respectively. The acquisition was done usi ng Photometrics Evolve 512 back -illuminated 
EMCCD.  
 
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 
Inverted Leica confocal microscope (SP5) equipped with a Z -galvo stage, MP excitation, and 
temperature control (whole microscope). A standard or resonant scanner (8000 Hz, 8000 
lines/s) was used for fast imaging. Argon laser (458 nm, 40 %) was used for exc itation of the 
stoichiometric FRET couple (CFP/YFP) expressing cells. CX PL APO 40x/1.25-0.75 OIL objective 
was used for acquisition. The acquisition was done with photo-multiplier tube (PMT) detectors 
at an interval of 1 min. Quantitative ratiometric analysis (Donor/acceptor) of images was done 
using MATLAB software from Danuser Lab. (Hodgson et al., 2010). 
 
 
Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED) 
Post immunostaining, cells were imaged on a STED imaging setup equipped with confocal 
imaging. This was performed using an Abberior 3D -2 Color -STED system (Abberior 
Instruments, Göttingen) with a 100X N.A 1.4 oil objective (Olympus). Star580 was imaged with 
a pulsed laser at 560 nm, and excitation o f Abberior Star Red and SiR -actin probe was

performed at 640 nm. The depletion laser for both colours was a 775 nm pulsed laser (Katana 
HP, 3W, 1 ns pulse duration, NKT Photonics). STED images were acquired in Honigmann Lab. 
at MPI CBG Dresden. 
 
 
Myosin cluster and ring analysis and statistics 
Ring diameters and intensity profiles were measured with ImageJ. The onset of the analysis (t 
= 0) was taken from the start point where the diameter was 5 0 +/ - 2 µm. Speeds were 
computed through changes in diameters over time steps of 30 min. Clusters with a lifetime of 
shorter than 6 minutes were not used for analysis. The cluster contrast was determined by 
dividing the intensity of a cluster by the mean intensity of the whole ring perimeter. The 
cluster density depicts the number of clusters per ring perimeter averaged over time. A cluster 
was determined by using kymographs and tracing the clusters via Cartesian coordinates. 
Retraction velocity after  laser ablation  data was determined by calculating the distance 
between the retracting fronts over time. The computation of the velocity field of cell 
movement with respect to the cluster movement was done using the Particle Image 
Velocimetry (PIV) technique utilizing PIVlab open source software.  All error bars indicate the 
standard error on the mean. The statistical significance was tested with a one-way analysis of 
variance and accepted at p < 0.05.  For correlative analysis of the FRET-MRLC signal, we sliced 
the ring along its perimeter in sections of 0.5 µm x 1 µm (radial x tangential). In each section, 
we measured the average MRLC density and the average FRET activity and normalized values 
for each ring section with respect to the ring average. To distinguish perimete r slices 
containing clusters from others, we manually tracked radial and tangential clusters using the 
Manual Tracking plugin in ImageJ.  
 
Analysis of laser ablation experiments 
Acto-myosin ring and myosin clusters consist of a dynamic network of crosslinked actin and 
myosin filaments, generating active stresses within this network. Hence, post ablated 
retracting acto-myosin ring fronts behave as active viscoelastic material (Kruse et al., 2005) . 
Such viscoelastic material shows elastic behaviour at short time scales. Therefore, the 
retraction velocity upon ablation corresponds to stress stored within the acto -myosin ring, 
and is representative of total mechanical tension prior ablation. We measu red the retraction 
velocity in radial clusters, in tangential clusters, and in the absence of clusters. We also 
measured the response of purely tangential clusters on wound rings with pillars left inside the 
monolayer. To evaluate tension corresponding to radial and tangential clusters, data were 
fitted with nonlinear exponential decay curve given by the equation: 𝜈 = −
𝑇0
𝜁 𝑒−𝑡/𝜏 , with v 
the velocity of closure, T0 is the tension prior ablation and 𝜁 is the damping coefficient (Mayer 
et al., 2010). 𝜁 characterises the frictional loss during interaction of the acto-myosin network 
with the surrounding  fluid. We expect no changes in the value of 𝜁. Hence, ratio of initial 
velocities 𝜈 equates to ratio of tension and acts as a readout for the stress associated with 
distinct cluster types.

Figure 1: Myosin clusters in the acto -myosin cable drive wound closure, radial clusters generate 
stress. (A) Wounds are created in an epithelial sheet by attaching micro-fabricated PDMS pillars on the 
microscope slide. After cell seeding, an epithelial sheet forms between pillars. We can image the setup 
with fluorescence microscopy and phase -contrast. Scalebars represent 50 µm. (B) The PDMS pillars 
can be detached from the microscope slide, and the wound closes. We observe myosin clusters during 
wound closure (snapshot series, left), and gener ate kymographs to track their motion (right and 
bottom). We classify them in two categories: radial clusters (green boxes) do not move along the 
periphery of the wound, contrary to tangential clusters (violet boxes). Scalebars represent 50 µm. (C) 
Myosin clusters cannot cross cell -cell junctions at the wound ring. We illustrate a representative 
example of a dynamic cluster trapped between two cell -cell junctions (marked by E -Cadherin). 
Overview of the wound ring (left) and time lapse of cluster dyna mics (right). The cluster is trapped 
between the cell-cell junctions. Scalebar represents 20 µm. (D) The percentage of radial clusters on a 
wound ring correlates with the velocity of wound closure, suggesting that radial clusters contribute 
more to wound closure (data from 25 wounds, 76 clusters). (E) Super resolution images of myosin 
clusters. Stimulated emission depletion (STED, top) of myosin and actin near a cluster. Correlative light 
and electron microscopy (CLEM, bottom) of two clusters around a cell-cell junction. Red arrows on the 
F-Actin image indicate the position of the two clusters that are enlarged on the EM image. Scalebar in 
fluorescence image represents 2 µm, scalebar in EM image represents 1 µm. (F) Time lapse of laser 
ablation experiments on a radial (top) and tang ential (bottom) clusters. Upon ablation (yellow arrow 
at time 1:00:00 indicates ablation point), the acto -myosin cable snaps open (yellow bars delimitate 
acto-myosin cable opening). Scalebar represents 20 µm. (G) We quantify the retracted length as a 
function of time, post -ablation. Cable portions with radial clusters retract faster than portions with 
tangential clusters (solid bar and shaded area represent mean  ± 95 % CI from 11 ablations on radial 
clusters, 8 ablations on tangential clusters). (H) Box -plots of initial retraction velocity measured for

activity, we used a RhoA FRET biosensor. See Material & Methods for details. (B) Fluorescence image

activity. On this timescale, the ablated cable reforms a complete acto -myosin cable associated with a 
burst in RhoA activity (ablation is performed on the cluster indicated by the yellow arrow in the first 
panel). Scalebars represent 10 µm. (D) Graph of RhoA activity as a function of myosin density measured 
in short sections of the acto-myosin cable on clusters of both types (green crosses, violet dots) and on 
the cable (grey dots). When myosin density is high, RhoA activity plateaus to an averag e value. This 
plateau is where all crosses corresponding to clusters are located in the graph. Radial (violet) and 
tangential (green) clusters are located together in this region (points are collected from 13 radial 
clusters, 36 tangential clusters, on 16 wound rings). (E) RhoA activity (green) and myosin density (red) 
temporal evolution after ablation, at the timescale of cable reformation. RhoA activity peaks before 
myosin density (solid lines and shaded areas indicate Mean ± SEM from 5 ablations). Joined triangles 
at the bottom of the graph indicate the peak RhoA activity and myosin density for individual 
experiments, showing the temporal advance of RhoA density peaks on myosin density peaks.

Figure S1. Schematic representation of protocols used to obtain multicellular rings : (A) Formation of 
rings in cell monolayer is obtained by (i) first the glass coverslip and the PDMS stamp with pillars is 
plasma activated, carefully. (ii) Next, they are bonded with each other and left at room temperature 
for 1h. (iii) After passivation with Pluronic acid for 1h, cells are introduced from all sides to ensure an 
even distribution, avoiding the pressure difference. (iv) Next, the assembly is  incubated for 12-16h at 
37°C and 5% CO 2 for cell spreading. (v) After removal of the PDMS pillars, reproducible shape 
controlled wound rings can be obtained (scale bar 50 µm). (B) Formation of single cell layer doughnut 
shape rings obtained by first incubating the PDMS stamp with fibronectin solution (100 µg/mL) for 30 
min. This is followed by (i) bonding this PDMS stamp to Piranha cleaned and silanized coverslip. A 
weight is put on top of it, for an evenly distributed fibronec tin stamping. This gives a glass coverslip 
stamped with fibronectin doughnut shape rings . (ii) This fibronectin stamped glass coverslip is next 
incubated with PLL-g-PEG (100 µg/mL) for 20 min to (iii) passivate the surface outside and inside the 
fibronectin doughnut shape rings. (iv) Next, epithelial (MDCK) cells are seeded on the coverslip and 
incubated for 1 h in low serum (1 % FBS) DMEM culture medium. After 1 h, the coverslip is washed 
with a new medium to remove the loosely attached cells settled on the passivated parts of the 
coverslip. (v) Next, the cells are allowed to spread for 30 min inside an incubator maintained at 37 °C 
with 5 % CO2, forming epithelial doughnut shape rings (scale bar 50 µm).

Figure S3. Myosin conservation and turnover in the acto -myosin ring: (A(i)) Myosin intensity profile 
across the wound, showing peaks in the acto -myosin cable (error bars: SEM, data from n=12 rings). 
Intensity data is normalized relative to the basal myosin levels at the ring periphery (extreme left and 
right pixels). The yellow line in the inset represents the line used to extract graph data. The insets show 
myosin fluorescence (scalebar: 10 μm). (A(ii)) Relative total (blue) and mean (red) intensities of the 
ring over time during constriction (error bars: SEM, data from n=3, 50 rings). The insets show myosin 
fluorescence (scale bar: 10 µm). (B) My osin conservation evaluated by plotting relative myosin loss 
(blue) and change in diameter (red) during ring constriction, showing a constant myosin loss and 
therefore conservation of myosin (error bars: SEM, data from 4 rings). (C(i)) Myosin turnover evaluated 
by photobleaching the acto -myosin ring (top) as well as a myosin cluster (bottom), followed by 
fluorescence recovery between the bleached ends (magenta arrowheads) (inverted contrast, time 
code in hh:mm:ss, scale bar 5 µm). (C (ii-iii)) Fluorescence recovery evaluated over time for the cluster 
(ii) and the ring (iii) showing faster myosin turnover at the ring as compared to the cluster (data from 
n=3, 13 rings, 9 clusters). Insets show myosin fluorescence (inverted contrast, scale bar: 5 µm).

Figure S5. Myosin cluster density and characterization, at the wound ring perimeter: A. (i) Absolute 
cluster number and (ii) average cluster number, follows a decreasing trend corresponding to closing 
rings and/with increasing time, respectively. (iii) Cluster density evaluated to be constant across 
different time points Error bars SEM, n=3/N=55 rings. B. (i) Cluster (inset: yellow) contrast evaluated 
by intensity calculations of the cluster with respect to the ring background (inset: red) during 
constriction. The relative values were calculated with respect to the first time point. Error bars: SEM, 
n=3/ N=44 rings, scale bar 5μm. C (i): Angular displacement of clusters on a ring over time. Radial 
clusters (violet) do not change angular position compared to tangential clusters (green). During ring 
constriction. C (ii): Displacement of clusters on a ring over time. Radial clusters (violet) driving by 
wound closure move more than tangential clusters (green).

Figure S6. Correlation of wound closure velocity with percentage of radial clusters on the ring.  We 
measured the number of radial clusters (out of the total number of clusters) on wound rings, and we 
measured the closure velocity. A high percentage of radial clusters correlates with fast wound closure 
(data from 26 wounds, 75 clusters).

Figure S 7. Dynamics of myosin clusters w.r.t the corresponding cell edge: Movement of myosin 
clusters and the cell edge was visualized by MRLC-KO1 (Kusabira orange) and Ecad-mNG (Neon green) 
respectively. A. (i) Initial state of three different clusters and their direction is indicated by color boxes 
and arrow heads respectively (red, orange, and yellow, one color per cluster). (ii) Corresponding 
dynamics of the clusters are tracked and depicted with their respective colored boxes. B. (Upper panel) 
Change in position of the cell edge was determined for the entire time period with respect to the 
reference (00:00:00). (Lower panel) Corresponding change in position of cluster 1 (red) 2 (orange) and 
3 (yellow) was analysed with respect to to their initial positions showing dynamics independent of the 
cell edge movement. C. Cell area relative to the first time point (00:00:00) was shown to be constant 
with time. Time in hh:mm:ss. Scale bar:10 µm.
