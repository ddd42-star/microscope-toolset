PtdIns5P is a lipid messenger acting as a stress-response mediator in the nucleus, and known
to maintain cell activation through trafﬁc alterations upon bacterial infection. Here, we show
that PtdIns5P regulates actin dynamics and invasion via recruitment and activation of the
exchange factor Tiam1 and Rac1. Restricted Rac1 activation results from the binding of Tiam1
DH-PH domains to PtdIns5P. Using an assay that mimics Rac1 membrane anchoring by using
Rac1-His and liposomes containing Ni2 þ -NTA modiﬁed lipids, we demonstrate that intrinsic
Tiam1 DH-PH activity increases when Rac1 is anchored in a PtdIns5P-enriched environment.
This pathway appears to be general since it is valid in different pathophysiological models:
receptor tyrosine kinase activation, bacterial phosphatase IpgD expression and the invasive
NPM-ALK(þ ) lymphomas. The discovery that PtdIns5P could be a keystone of GTPases and
cytoskeleton spatiotemporal regulation opens important research avenues towards unravel-
ling new strategies counteracting cell invasion.

P
hosphoinositides (PIs) are spatiotemporal organizers
of signal transduction, rearrangement of the actin cyto-
skeleton, intracellular vesicle trafﬁcking and survival 1,2.
They have speciﬁc localizations within cells that account for
recruitment of effectors displaying PI-binding domains such as
PH, FYVE, FERM, PHOX and more recently PHD to regulate
signalling3. Deregulation and mutations in PI-metabolizing
enzymes take part in the development of human pathologies
including genetic diseases and cancer 4,5. Phosphatidylinositol
5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) metabolism and functions remain poorly
understood. It is present at low levels in many cell types, and
several physiological and pathophysiological challenges alter
PtdIns5P levels, indicating that it is a signalling molecule, in
addition to having housekeeping functions6,7.
A large body of studies over the years has focused on nuclear
PtdIns5P, identifying it as a stress-induced second messenger
that regulates apoptosis by binding the PHD domain of the
chromatin-regulator ING2 (refs 8,9). Cell fractionation
demonstrated that while the majority of bulk PtdIns5P is
present in the plasma membrane, it is also enriched in
intracellular membrane compartments including endosomes,
smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the trans-Golgi
network10,11. Our group pioneered studies demonstrating that
PtdIns5P was produced upon bacterial infection of HeLa cells by
the human pathogens Shigella ﬂexneri and Salmonella
typhimurium12,13. S. ﬂexneri’s virulence factor, IpgD, is a potent
4-phosphatase that converts PtdIns(4,5)P 2 into PtdIns5P
and contributes to dramatic F-actin remodelling, facilitating
bacterial entry and inducing alteration of trafﬁcking through
PtdIns5P accumulation on early endosomes to maintain host
cell activation 10,13,14. Additional studies in different models
conﬁrmed that PtdIns5P impacts actin reorganization. PtdIns5P
produced by the PI 5-kinase PIKfyve was implicated in insulin-
induced F-actin breakdown, thereby regulating trafﬁcking of
vesicles containing the GLUT4 glucose transporter from
intracellular membranes pools to the plasma membrane15–17.I n
line with these observations, recent studies have identiﬁed
PtdIns5P as the central molecule regulating cell migration in
response to FGF-1 in ﬁbroblasts and in border cells during
Drosophila embryogenesis, where its production is locally
regulated at the endosomal level by the interplay of PIKfyve
and the PI 3-phosphatase MTMR3 (ref. 15). However, the precise
molecular mechanisms linking PtdIns5P to actin dynamics and
migration are still unknown.
Our previous work on anaplastic lymphomas expressing the
tyrosine kinase oncogene NPM-ALK demonstrated that the
oncogene activated PIKfyve to produce PtdIns5P. Moreover,
invasiveness of NPM-ALK(þ ) cells was regulated not only by
PIKfyve but also by the Rac1 GTPase 18–21. Knowing the
importance of Rho GTPases as molecular switches regulating a
wide array of cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton remodelling,
membrane dynamics and migration in response to PIs, they
represent ideal candidates to link PtdIns5P to the aforementioned
cellular responses22,23.
With those observations in mind, we sought to investigate
whether PtdIns5P could activate Rho GTPases signalling and
address the functionality of such activation using various models.
Three complementary models were used to evaluate the general
nature of the mechanism. We ﬁrst studied FGF-1 stimulation of
RPE-1 cells; second, we used the bacterial phosphatase IpgD to
produce PtdIns5P in MEFs; and third, we analysed NPM-
ALK( þ) anaplastic lymphomas. We ﬁnd that PtdIns5P elevation
is responsible for Rac1 activation in all three models and identify
the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tiam1 (T-cell
lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1) as being activated by
PtdIns5P and required for Rac1 activation. We demonstrate that
the C-terminal regulatory PH domain (PHc) of Tiam1 binds
speciﬁcally to PtdIns5P, leading to recruitment of active Tiam1/
Rac1 to early endosomes and dorsal rufﬂes. This is mandatory for
robust change in actin and membrane dynamics upon PtdIns5P
elevation. Interestingly, elevated levels of PtdIns5P induce
invasion in pathophysiological contexts, being even sufﬁcient to
trigger invasive capabilities in cells that are otherwise not able to
migrate in 3D. These observations broaden the understanding of
PtdIns5P by suggesting that it can integrate several upstream
signals to coordinate trafﬁcking as well as actin and membrane
dynamics to regulate invasion.
Results
PtdIns5P induces Rac1 and Cdc42 activation. To elucidate how
PtdIns5P could affect actin dynamics and migration, we ﬁrst
focused on the Rho GTPases, which are good candidates to
integrate PI signalling and cytoskeletal dynamics. To allow ﬁne-
tuning of PtdIns5P production, we developed inducible Tet-Off
MEF cell lines stably expressing Myc-EGFP-IpgD (called MEF-
IpgD), a bacterial phosphatase that transforms PtdIns(4,5)P 2
into PtdIns5P (ref. 13). As controls, inducible MEF cell lines
expressing the Myc-EGFP-Inp54p phosphatase (PtdIns(4,5)P2
5-phosphatase that produces PtdIns4P) and Myc-EGFP-IpgD
C438S (a phosphatase-dead mutant called MEF-IpgD-CS) were
also generated. MEF-IpgD were characterized by the production
of high levels of PtdIns5P and a concomitant drop in
PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a), reproducing
what is observed with S. ﬂexneri-infected or IpgD-expressing
HeLa cells10,13,14. Mass assay24, together with confocal imaging
using the GST-FYVE (Hrs) probe that binds to PtdIns3P,
demonstrated that IpgD expression did not affect signiﬁcantly
PtdIns3P levels nor distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c).
Activation of known PtdIns5P response pathways, Akt,
GSK3 and FHKR, validated the cell lines for further studies
(Supplementary Fig. 1d)10,14. As expected, no change in PtdIns5P
and PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels nor Akt activation were observed with
the MEF-IpgD-CS cell line (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a,e).
Expression of IpgD resulted in a strong activation of both Rac1
and Cdc42, while RhoA remained stable (Fig. 1b). As a control,
co-expression of IpgD and PIP4KII/C25, which drastically reduced
the amount of PtdIn5P (Fig. 1a), brought Rac1- and Cdc42-GTP
back to control levels (Fig. 1b). Inp54p and IpgD-CS expressions
resulted in no change in Rac1 or Cdc42 activation (Fig. 1b,c).
Importantly, study of the F-actin conﬁrmed that IpgD expression
induced disappearance of actin stress ﬁbres, while cortical actin
was not affected. Treatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766
(ref. 25) restored F-actin polymerization, demonstrating that Rac
was responsible for PtdIns5P-dependent actin remodelling
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Interestingly, activation of Cdc42 by
PtdIns5P was not involved in F-actin dynamics inside the cell but
was instrumental to cortical actin assembly since no pericellular
actin staining could be seen upon treatment with secramine A26,a
potent inhibitor of Cdc42 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This
observation suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42 might regulate
different actin pools downstream of PtdIns5P.
Time-course experiments performed on MEFs treated with
short-chain PtdInsPs demonstrated that PtdIns5P was respon-
sible for GTPase activation and F-actin breakdown (Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). We had previously identiﬁed class I PI
3-kinases sensitive to LY294002 inhibition as targets activated by
PtdIns5P14. GTPases pull-downs performed in MEF-IpgD or
control MEFs challenged with synthetic PtdIns5P in the presence
of LY294002 demonstrated that PI 3-kinases were not responsible
for Rac1 activation in this context (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b).
Since Rac1 had the strongest impact on actin dynamics, we

focused on the study of this GTPase downstream of PtdIns5P in
physiological and pathological models: RPE-1 cells stimulated by
FGF-1 and anaplastic lymphomas expressing the NPM-ALK
oncogene.
It was recently shown that FGF-1 stimulated 2D migration of
BJ foreskin ﬁbroblasts by producing PtdIns5P through a
signalling cascade that involved the class III PI 3-kinase Vps34,
PIKfyve and the MTMR3 myotubularin 15,27. We therefore
checked whether PtdIns5P was a feature of FGF-1 stimulation
by measuring PtdIns5P production in RPE-1 cells. When
challenged with FGF-1, an important transitory increase in
PtdIns5P peaking at 15 min of stimulation was observed (Fig. 1e).
FGF-1 also induced activation of Rac1 in a PtdIns5P-dependent
way since sequestration of this PI with the trapping probe GFP-
3xPHD8,10 dropped Rac1-GTP back to control levels (Fig. 1f). To
go further into deciphering the metabolic pathway of PdIns5P
upon FGF-1 stimulation, RPE-1 cells were metabolically labelled
with [32P]orthophosphate before stimulation. A signiﬁcant drop
in PtdIns3P amounts was observed after 5–15 min of treatment,
while levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 and other PIs were hardly affected
(Fig. 1g,h). This suggested that PtdIns3P could be a precursor of
PtdIns5P synthesis through transformation into PtdIns(3,5)P2 by
PIKfyve and subsequent dephosphorylation by a 3-Phosphatase
as demonstrated by Oppeltet al.15 in BJ ﬁbroblasts. The lack of a
concomitant decrease in PtdIns(3,5)P2 could reﬂect a rapid and
transient metabolization difﬁcult to assess with such an elusive PI.
However, these observations do not rule out the possibility that
PtdIns5P could come from the action of PIKfyve on PtdIns.
The impact of PtdIns5P on Rho GTPases was also analysed in a
pathological context by studying anaplastic large-cell lymphomas
expressing the NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase oncogene. We
previously demonstrated that NPM-ALK(þ) cells had elevated
levels of PtdIns5P, which could be attributed to activation of
PIKfyve by the oncogene in NPM-ALK-expressing NIH-3T3
ﬁbroblasts21,28. We used the Cost and Karpas 299 patient-derived
cell lines and showed by treatment with the YM201636 inhibitor
and shRNA depletion that PIKfyve was responsible for the
increase in PtdIns5P in these cells (Fig. 2a,b). Treatment with
the YM201636 inhibitor, PIKfyve shRNA, or expression of
GFP-3xPHD, clearly demonstrated that PtdIns5P production
was also responsible for Rac1 activation in NPM-ALK(þ) cells
(Fig. 2c–e). Together, these data demonstrate that PtdIns5P-
induced activation of Rho GTPases and the subsequent
modulation of actin dynamics are prevalent mechanisms
observed in different models.
The RacGEF Tiam1 is activated upon PtdIns5P elevation .
Rho GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an
active GTP-bound state with the assistance of GEFs, which are
required for proper local GTPase activation29. The Rac inhibitor
NSC23766 blocks interaction between Rac1 and a subset of its
GEFs, namely Tiam1 and Trio 25. Tiam1 is speciﬁc for Rac1
in vivo and has been involved in Rac1-induced cytoskeleton
remodelling, motility and invasion in many different cell
types30,31. Interestingly, pull-down experiments with the
nucleotide free mutant GST-Rac1 G15A, which display high
afﬁnity for active GEFs, demonstrated that Tiam1 was activated
upon PtdIns5P elevation in FGF-1-treated RPE-1 cells and
MEF-IpgD, whereas an unrelated GEF for RhoA (p115 RhoGEF)
was not. Accordingly, pre-treatment of cells with NSC23766
abolished Tiam1 association to RacG15A (Fig. 3a,b). Subcellular
fractionation of control MEFs, MEF-IpgD or MEF-Inp54p
conﬁrmed that the relocation of Tiam1 to the heavy membrane
fraction that marked its activation was only observed upon IpgD
expression (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The GST-Cdc42G15A mutant
did not pull down any active Tiam1 (not shown). Rac1 G15A
pull-downs also demonstrated that Tiam1 was activated in
NPM-ALK( þ ) anaplastic lymphomas (Fig. 3c). The NPM-ALK
inhibitor WHI-154 prevented Tiam1 from binding to Rac1G15A
in both Karpas 299 and Cost cells, indicating that the oncogene
was responsible for Tiam1 activation (Fig. 3c). Tiam1 was
previously identiﬁed as part of the proteomic signature of
NPM-ALK, reinforcing the idea of its involvement in NPM-ALK-
mediated tumorigenicity32. Immunoprecipitations conﬁrmed that
Tiam1 was a binding partner of the oncogene (Supplementary
Fig. 4b), and demonstrated that it was a tyrosine phosphorylation
target of NPM-ALK (Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Moreover, ectopic expression of IpgD in Tiam1/C0 //C0 primary
MEFs (Fig. 3d) in which the GEF had been knocked out33 as
well as exogenous PtdIns5P stimulation of WT MEFs pre-treated
with NSC23766 failed to activate Rac1, showing that Tiam1 is
essential for Rac1 activation in response to PtdIns5P elevation
(Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). Importantly, PtdIns5P-elicited F-actin
breakdown was totally abolished in Tiam1 /C0 //C0 MEFs, which
conserved strong actin ﬁbres (Fig. 3e,g). Re-expression of
Tiam1 in Tiam1 /C0 //C0 MEFs restored PtdIns5P-dependent
F-actin disappearance, conﬁrming that Tiam1 was responsible
for this effect (Fig. 3f,g).
The known NPM-ALK-dependent actin disassembly that was
previously shown to be regulated by Rac18, was also blocked when
NPM-ALK was expressed in Tiam1/C0 //C0 MEFs, as shown by the
persistence of actin ﬁbres (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Of note, NPM-
ALK-expressing Tiam1/C0 //C0 MEF exhibited ﬁlopodia, suggesting
that activation of Cdc42 downstream of the oncogene was
maintained in the absence of Tiam1 (Supplementary Fig. 4f, white
arrows). In agreement with the lack of NPM-ALK-dependent
actin ﬁbres remodelling in Tiam1/C0 //C0 cells, the invasion elicited
by expression of the oncogene was blocked in Tiam1/C0 //C0 MEF
(Supplementary Fig. 4g). Together, these data point to PtdIns5P
acting on the Tiam1/Rac1 module as a general way of eliciting
actin remodelling in various cell systems.
Tiam1 PHc preferentially binds to PtdIns5P. Tiam1 has the
particularity of bearing two PH domains. While the N-terminal
domain (PHn) seems to be critical for protein interactions and
Tiam1 localization, the PHc domain, contained in the catalytic
DH-PH region, is responsible for Tiam1 exchange activity34,35
(Fig. 4a). It had been previously reported that the PHc domain
displayed afﬁnity for PtdIns3P (ref. 36). We used recombinant
GST-DH-PHc to probe PIP strips and PIP arrays (serial dilution
of various PIPs) to check whether it had afﬁnity for other PIs.
These experiments not only conﬁrmed that Tiam1 PHc bound to
PtdIns3P but also revealed that it displayed a stronger afﬁnity for
PtdIns5P (Fig. 4b,c), whereas Tiam1 PHn preferentially bound to
PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4d and ref. 37). Lysines
from both variable loops L1 (/C251//C252) and L2 (/C252//C253) of the Tiam1
PHc have been shown to be required for PtdIns3P binding36
(Fig. 4a). We repeated the experiments using mutants where the
lysines were substituted by glutamines and demonstrated that
those residues were important for binding to both PtdIns3P and
PtdIns5P (Fig. 4c). Sedimentation assays with liposomes
containing a mix of PC:PE and either PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P or
PtdIns5P conﬁrmed that GST-DH-PHc-Tiam1 only bound
liposomes bearing either PC:PE:PtdIns3P or PC:PE:PtdIns5P
(Fig. 4e). The stronger binding to PtdIns5P-containing
liposomes conﬁrmed that Tiam1 PHc preferentially interacted
with PtdIns5P.
PtdIns5P stimulates Tiam1 DH-PHc activityin vitro. We next
analysed the effect of PtdIns5P on the intrinsic Tiam1 GEF

activity by performingin vitro nucleotide exchange assays using
recombinant Rac1 loaded with bodipy-FL-GDP. It has been
previously reported that the DH-PHc of Tiam1 displayed a much
better activity on prenylated Rac-GDP bound to liposomes versus
non prenylated soluble Rac-GDP 36,38. These observations
suggested that anchoring of Rac-GDP to membranes was
important for proper presentation of the GTPase to the DH-PH
domain. Rearrangement of the DH-PH structure following
association with PtdInsP would then stimulate GDP to GTP
exchange.
We then used the ﬁndings of a recent study by Maleckaet al.39
to adapt a system that mimics the prenylation-dependent
membrane anchoring of GTPases by creating liposomes
containing PC, PE and lipids bearing a modiﬁed Ni 2 þ-NTA
head group (DGS-NTA(Ni)) capable of binding to a recombinant
C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged version of Rac1 (Fig. 5a).

Sedimentation assays conﬁrmed approximately stoichiometric
binding of Rac1-His to the Ni2 þ-NTA lipid exposed on the
liposomes’ outer surface39 (Fig. 5b). We then performed exchange
assays using liposomes bearing different PtdInsP species and
Rac1-His loaded with bodipy FL-GDP in the presence of soluble
Tiam1 DH-PHc. Maximum exchange activity was achieved by
adding EDTA to the reaction, while spontaneous Rac1 exchange
was assessed in the presence of buffer only. In the presence of
PtdIns5P-bearing liposomes, we observed a strong Tiam1
exchange activity, while PtdIns4P had no effect (Fig. 5c,d). In
this assay, we also observed a weak increase in Tiam1 exchange
activity in the presence of PtdIns3P-bearing liposomes,
demonstrating that both PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P could
potentiate Tiam1 activity in vitro (Fig. 5c,d). Our observations
demonstrate the potency of this assay that mimics membrane and
proteins functional interactions. These results suggest that Tiam1

recruitment by PtdIns5P is sufﬁcient to increase intrinsic Tiam1
exchange activity.
PtdIns5P, Tiam1 and Rac1 localize on endosomes within
rufﬂes. We then investigated the localization of PtdIns5P, Tiam1
and Rac1, knowing that PtdIns5P produced by IpgD expression
in HeLa and BHK cells rapidly accumulates on early
endosomes10. We focused on MEF-IpgD as a model because
they are easy to image and IpgD-elicited increase in PtdIns5P
recapitulated Tiam1/Rac1 activation and actin dynamics observed
in other models (this and other studies10,13,14,21,28). Cells were

MEF-IpgD exhibited a strong dorsal and peripheral rufﬂing
activity and extended large lamellipodia to probe the matrix
surrounding the micropattern (Supplementary Fig. 5a, left panel).
Time-lapse experiments demonstrated that rufﬂing was polarized
(Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).
Plating on circular micropatterns led to a loss of polarization, but
MEF-IpgD retained a strong rufﬂing activity around the cell body
(Supplementary Fig. 5a, right panel, and Supplementary Movies 3
and 4). PtdIns5P was visualized using the GST-2xPHD probe.
PtdIns5P decorates intracellular vesicles localized at the foot of
dorsal rufﬂes, sites with strong actin dynamics as shown
by phalloidin staining, reinforcing the idea of a functional
link between PtdIns5P, trafﬁcking and rufﬂe formation
(Supplementary Fig. 5b, zooms). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated that Tiam1, Rac1 and PtdIns5P partially
colocalized with vesicles positive for EEA1, a marker of early
endosomes, suggesting that PtdIns5P was recruiting the Tiam1/
Rac1 module on these vesicles (Fig. 6a,b). As protein–protein
association can be very transient and colocalization of several
partners impaired by sterical hindrance on small structures such
as vesicles, we also performed a Proximity Ligation Assay

of interactions 41. This analysis conﬁrmed the data obtained
by immunoﬂuorescence staining (Supplementary Fig. 6). Weak
colocalization could also be detected in control MEFs at
structures where basal levels of PtdIns5P were present
(Supplementary Fig. 7a, line scans a and d). Study of Cdc42
localization demonstrated that it was mostly located at the plasma
membrane in MEF-IpgD (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
While re-expression of WT Tiam1 restored F-actin breakdown
in Tiam1/C0 //C0 MEFs, expression of the Tiam1-L1L2 mutant that
cannot bind PtdIns5P was not capable of remodelling actin upon
PtdIns5P increase (Fig. 7). Morphological analysis demonstrated
that overexpression of WT Tiam1 together with PtdIns5P
treatment resulted in the appearance of enlarged vesicles positive
for EEA1, suggesting that they worked together to affect
trafﬁcking. Accordingly, overexpression of Tiam1 L1L2 did not

affect the structure of EEA1 endosomes, demonstrating that
Tiam1 binding to PtdIns5P was mandatory for this effect to occur
(Fig. 7, zooms). In line with this observation, Tiam1 L1L2 was not
recruited to EEA1 endosomes as was WT-Tiam1 (Fig. 7, zooms
and linescans).
Taken together, these data favour the hypothesis that PtdIns5P
enrichment in early endosomes recruits and locally activates the
Tiam1/Rac1 module to drive targeted actin and membrane
dynamics.
PtdIns5P regulates Rac1 activity in rufﬂes and vesicles. Active
Rac1 has been reported to localize in rufﬂes and early endosomes,
where we demonstrated PtdIns5P to be enriched in several cell
types10,13,42. Indeed, Rac1 is a pivotal regulator of actin dynamics,
which drives the formation of membrane protrusions such as
lamellipodia, peripheral and dorsal circular rufﬂes (unique sites
where spatially restricted actin remodelling controls cellular
motility). Observation of Rac1 localization over time by
monitoring the CFP ﬂuorescence of Raichu-Rac1 demonstrated
that Rac1 was not only present on early endosomes (Fig. 8a) but
also relocated to rufﬂes when levels of PtdIns5P increased
(Fig. 8a). Dynamic analysis revealed that CFP-Rac1-containing
dorsal rufﬂes moved towards the edge of the lamellipodium
before being engulfed, illustrating the polarization of this process
(Fig. 8a, zoom and kymograph). We then recorded FRET (Fo¨rster
Resonance Energy Transfer) emitted by the Raichu-Rac1
biosensor over time to monitor local activity of the Tiam1/Rac1
module43. When MEF-IpgD were spatially restricted on
micropatterns, active Rac1 could be observed at the cell
periphery and in circular rufﬂes that were moving along the
lamellipodium (Figs 8b and 9c, and Supplementary Movie 5).
When plated on non-patterned ﬁbronectin, cells spread out on
the coverslips and extend lamellipodia, resulting in a lower rate of
rufﬂing44, and therefore facilitating FRET imaging of discrete
internal structures such as vesicles. Real-time imaging of non-
patterned cells revealed that Rac1 was also active on small vesicles
that were moving within the lamellipodium (Figs 8c and 9b, and
Supplementary Movie 6). When MEFs were not challenged with
PtdIns5P, Raichu-Rac1 ﬂuorescence was largely cytosolic and no
activation could be detected over time (Figs 8d and 9c,
Supplementary Fig. 8a, and Supplementary Movies 7 and 8).
Again, monitoring of FRET activity in Tiam1 /C0 //C0 MEFs
demonstrated that no activation of Raichu-Rac1 was detected in
the absence of GEF when PtdIns5P was added to the cells (Figs 8e
and 9c, and Supplementary Movie 9).

No Rac1 activation was either observed in serum-starved
control MEFs, while IpgD-MEFs displayed a strong FRET signal
in rufﬂes and vesicles (Fig. 9a,b and d). To investigate the role of
endocytosis in Rac1 activity in rufﬂes and vesicles, cells were
treated with sucrose. After 2 h of treatment to allow cells to adapt
to the hypertonic medium generated by the addition of sucrose,
transferrin and dextran intakes were monitored. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 8b, endocytosis of both compounds was
blocked. No change in FRET activity was detected upon sucrose
treatment of control MEFs. However, Raichu-Rac1 activation was
only detected at the periphery of IpgD-MEFs, implying that
endocytosis and subsequent trafﬁcking were required to relocate
Rac1 and induce rufﬂing activity (Fig. 9a,d). FRET activity
was even greater at the plasma membrane of sucrose-treated
IpgD-MEFs, suggesting that IpgD-produced PtdIns5P was
probably found in endosomes as a result of endocytosis (Fig. 9d).
Altogether, those observations demonstrated that PtdIns5P
recruits Tiam1 at speciﬁc sites where actin and membrane
dynamics were increased due to subsequent activation of Rac1.
PtdIns5P triggers and drives invasive behaviour. Rac1 regulates
chemotaxis in response to growth factors such as EGF, PDGF,
HGF or serum via formation of lamellipodia and dorsal rufﬂes
driven by actin dynamics44,45. As already mentioned, FGF-1 has
been shown to elicit 2D migration through PIKfyve/MTMR3-
dependent production of PtdIns5P (ref. 15). Herein, we
demonstrated that the invasion through dense 3D-Matrigel by
RPE-1 cells challenged by a 10% serum gradient could be
recapitulated by an FGF-1 gradient (Fig. 10a). Interestingly, while
PtdIns5P trapping with GFP-3xPHD did not affect invasion
towards serum, FGF-1-dependent invasion was abrogated
(Fig. 10a). Accordingly, NSC23766 treatment had the same
effect on RPE-1 cells (Fig. 10b). Similar observations were made
in Cost and Karpas 299 cells, where invasiveness was tested
towards a gradient of FBS and SDF1a, demonstrating that the
PtdIns5P/Tiam1/Rac1 module was likely responsible for the effect
(Fig. 10c and Supplementary Fig. 10).
IpgD expression and subsequent PtdIns5P elevation were
capable of switching the phenotype of MEFs to highly motile and

cells displayed degradation areas (Fig. 10f). Invadopodia/invado-
somes are small needle-like membrane projections located at sites
of major structural dynamics where proteolytic degradation
occurs, at the ventral side of cells in 2D and in the direction of the
gradient in 3D46,47. By immunoﬂuorescence, invadosomes appear
as patched structures enriched in proteins that regulate
cytoskeleton and membrane remodelling, cell–ECM adhesion
and matrix degradation 47. Confocal sections followed by
orthogonal plotting of the images (z projection) demonstrated
that the digested zones contained cores of F-actin, a trademark of
functional invadosomes (Fig. 10f). The above observations
demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that PtdIns5P orchestrates
invasion through activation of Tiam1 and Rho GTPases to
restrict actin dynamics and allow matrix digestion.
Discussion
In this paper, we unravelled a new role for non-nuclear PtdIns5P
in cell invasion where it increases actin and membrane dynamics
through activation of the Tiam1/Rac1 module. We studied three
different pathophysiological situations, stimulation of RPE-1 cells
by FGF-1, ectopic expression of the bacterial IpgD phosphatase
and transformation by the NPM-ALK oncogene, and showed that
they all relied on this pathway to elicit 3D migration.
We used the Raichu probe to assess active Rac1 in cells. It is
known that this probe does not bind RhoGDI, suggesting it might
not behave in the same manner as endogenous Rac1. However,
Raichu-Rac1 has been shown to interact with other important
regulators of GTPases such as GAPs and GEFs, among which is
Tiam1, to regulate its local activity 48. Confocal microscopy

allowed us to detect FRET at sites of endogenous Rac1
localization, rufﬂes and vesicles. Recently, it was demonstrated
that recruitment of Tiam1 and Rac1 to early endosomes upon
endocytosis or activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) was
required for the spatial partitioning of active Rac to zones where
protrusive activity led to motility42,49. However, the molecular
mechanism for this recruitment was not studied. Our ﬁndings
indicate that PtdIns5P might be the missing link between
trafﬁcking and actin/membrane dynamics. We found a direct
binding between PtdIns5P and the Tiam1 PHc domain that
localized it to early endosomes and led to chemotaxis.
These ﬁndings shed new light on the complex relationship
between PIs and GEFs for Rho GTPases50. PIs interact with GEFs
through the PH domain associated to the DH domain responsible
for their exchange activity. GEFs are then localized at PI-enriched
membrane regions to activate their target GTPases and engage
downstream signalling for an accurate response to the initial
insult. However, most PH domains found in the DH-PH tandem
bind poly-PIs (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3) with low
afﬁnity and often require protein adaptors for efﬁcient
membrane association. A careful survey of the literature
highlights the fact that no systematic studies have been
undertaken to clearly assess the speciﬁcity of GEF PH
domains50. By adapting a method whereby Rac1 can be
anchored to liposomes bearing different PtdInsP, we could
demonstrate that PtdIns5P binding by Tiam1 DH-PHc
potentiates its intrinsic GEF function. GEF activation is in part
due to an improved probability for the formation of complexes
containing all three partners (Tiam1 DH-PHc, Rac1 and
PtdIns5P). However, since GEF DH-PH domains have weak
activity in solution, it also can be postulated that binding to
PtdIns5P-bearing liposomes favours a more active conformation
of the DH-PH towards interaction and exchange on Rac1
(ref. 38). Our method represents a signiﬁcant improvement since
previous studies failed to demonstrate any effect on GEF activity
via Tiam1 DH-PHc interaction with PtdIns3P in solution36.W e
conﬁrmed that PtdIns3P bound Tiam1 PHc, albeit with a lower
afﬁnity than PtdIns5P. In agreement, we could measure a weak
activation by PtdIns3P-bearing liposomes, demonstrating that
both PIs could activate Tiam1in vitro.
This observation has an important impact on cells, since we
have previously demonstrated that PtdIns5P accumulation on
early endosomes, known to be enriched in PtdIns3P, induced
trafﬁcking modiﬁcations. Indeed, Palamidessi et al. 42 and
Joffre et al.49 demonstrated that the activation of, respectively,
Tiam1/Rac1 and Rac1 and oncogenic mutants of the Met receptor
on early endosomes was instrumental to directed motility. In
HeLa and BHK cells, PtdIns5P endosome enrichment led to
stabilization and sustained activation of EGFR by blocking its
degradation and favoring recycling10. Endocytosis and trafﬁcking
have long been regarded merely as means of attenuating cell
activation through degradative pathways. The concept of
‘signalling endosomes’, which stems from the observation that
signalling persists along the endocytic route, shed new light on
how signalling pathways are regulated 51. Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that the assumption that endosomal PtdIns3P
accounted for those effects is not totally accurate and identify
PtdIns5P as an important component of endosome-associated
signalling. Since IpgD does not lead to modiﬁcation of total nor
endosomal PtdIns3P levels, our study indicates that PtdIns5P is
the main PI that recruits Tiam1 to early endosomes when high
levels of PtdIns5P are present. In this line of thought, localization
of PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P in MEF-IpgD demonstrated that they
colocalized on endomembranes. However, only PtdIns5P was
enriched at the plasma membrane and in rufﬂes (Supplementary
Fig. 9). Therefore, it is possible that under basal conditions, when
PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P are present in comparable amounts, they
could cooperate to achieve balance between degradation and
recycling of cargo during steady state trafﬁcking.
In FGF-1 signalling and NPM-ALK lymphomas, PIKfyve,
either alone or in coordination with MTMR3, has been
demonstrated to modulate the levels of PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,5)P2
and PtdIns5P (refs 15,21,28). However, in all cases, sequestration
of PtdIns5P by the GFP-3xPHD probe and complementation of
PIKfyve knock down by synthetic PtdIns5P or IpgD transfection
demonstrated that, indeed, PtdIns5P was the important PI for
effects on actin and migration.
Interestingly, our study opens a new ﬁeld of investigation on
GEFs as interacting partners and effectors of PtdIns5P, likely
accounting for some of the non-nuclear PtdIns5P functions.
Moreover, Miroshnychenkoet al.52 reported that the PH domain
of BCR also showed afﬁnity for PtdIns5P, but they did not
investigate it further. Additional studies are required to elucidate
the existence of PtdIns5P-responsive subfamilies of Rho GTPases
and GEFs.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that activation of Tiam1/Rac1 by
PtdIns5P is a potent signal that can reprogram non-migrating
cells to engage in both 2D- and 3D-directed migration. Indeed,
MEFs expressing high levels of PtdIns5P undergo a phenotypical
modiﬁcation reminiscent of cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts and
ﬁbroblasts activation during wound-healing processes53, where
they become highly invasive by increased motility and through
secretion of MMPs. Circular dorsal rufﬂes, also called ‘waves’,
share regulatory circuitry similar to invadosomes, which drive
motility in 3D matrices 44. Cdc42 is a central element of
invadosome structure and function54. Upon PtdIns5P increase,
Cdc42 is activated and regulates cortical actin, which might
cooperate with Rac1 to generate invadosomes. Accordingly, this
work and our previous studies demonstrated that Rac1 was
required to trigger matrix digestion 18–20. The discovery that
PtdIns5P is a central regulator of ECM remodelling, actin and
membranes dynamics, which are prerequisites for 3D migration,
broadens our view of how this phenomenon is regulated.
In conclusion, the sum of our work demonstrates that
PtdIns5P is an important mediator of signalling, leading to
invasion/3D migration in response to different extracellular or
oncogenic cues. The outcome of PtdIns5P elevation and of
Tiam1/Rac1 activation elicited by either RTK activation (FGF-1
or insulin17), bacterial infection or tumorigenesis can be either
beneﬁcial, in the case where physiological development requires
accurate cell motility, or detrimental, when exploited in
pathologies such as cancer, diabetes or bacterial infection.
Therefore, this work points to PtdIns5P as a crucial mediator
involved in determining cellular fate by acting at the crossroads of
cellular processes such as trafﬁcking, motility and response to
growth factors that have high pathophysiological relevance.
Targeting enzymes involved in its metabolism represent
therapeutic targets worth exploring for a wide array of
diseases.

Establishment of MEFs inducible cell lines. EGFP-IpgD, EGFP-Inp54p or
EGFP-IpgD-C438S were subcloned into the pTRE2-hyg-Myc expression vectors
(Clontech) by standard techniques. A total of 1/C2 106 MEF Tet-Off cells (Clontech)
expressing the tetracycline-controlled transactivator were plated in 100 mm dishes
and transfected with 2mg of pTRE2-hyg-Myc-EGFP-IpgD, pTRE2-hyg-Myc-
EGFP-Inp54p or pTRE2-hyg-Myc-EGFP-IpgD-C438S using Lipofectamine with
Plus Reagent (Life Technologies) and 2mgm l/C0 1 of doxycyclin (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added to avoid any protein expression during the selection process. Forty-eight
hous after transfection, 400mgm l/C0 1 of hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added.
Transformants were selected and single cells cloned using the limiting dilution
method. To test for induced expression, doxycyclin was removed from the medium
and EGFP-positive clones were selected and analysed by western blot for
expression of Myc-EGFP-IpgD, Myc-EGFP-Inp54p or Myc-EGFP-IpgD-C438S.
Lentivirus production and transduction. EGFP-3xPHD WT and EGFP-
3xPHDmut (cysteine mutant)-encoding sequences were subcloned from the
pEGFP-C1 plasmids8 into the pTRIP-IRES lentiviral vector plasmid57. Vector
particles were produced as previously described57. Cost and Karpas 299 cells were
transduced by incubation with lentiviral particles at an MOI of 1. Cells were
washed 24 h later and after an additional 48 h, EGFP-positive cells were sorted by
ﬂow cytometry on a BD FACSAria Sorp (BD Biosciences). RPE-1 cells were
transduced by incubation with lentiviral particles at an MOI of 1 for 3 days.
Transduction efﬁciency was checked by ﬂuorescence microscopy and reached
almost 100%. Cost and Karpas cells were transduced by incubation with lentiviral
particles at an MOI of 1 for 3 days and selected using 2mgm l/C0 1 puromycin.
Immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Total cellular proteins were extracted
with 50 mM Tris-base (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM
PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,1 0m gm l/C0 1 leupeptin and 2 mg ml/C0 1 aprotinin.
For cell fractionation, cells were scraped in detergent-free lysis buffer as described
above. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000g. The post-nuclear
supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000g. The supernatant (HSS) was
collected and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% TritonX-
100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate to obtain the membrane fractions (HSP). For
immunoprecipitations, clariﬁed homogenates were incubated overnight at 4/C176Cw i t h
the antibodies and a mix of protein A/G sepharose beads. After washes, proteins were
eluted with Laemmli buffer and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting
on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) with appropriate antibodies. Immunor-
eactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence using either medical X-ray ﬁlm
(Kodak) or chemidoc (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with the SuperSignal detection system
(Pierce). Quantiﬁcation was done using ImageJ or Chemidoc Image lab (Biorad
laboratories). Larger images of immunoblots shown in the main article are included in
Supplementary Fig. 12,13 and 14.
GTPase pull-downs and GEF trapping. The amounts of GTP-bound active Rac1,
Cdc42 or RhoA and active Tiam1 were determined by pull-downs as previously
described55,58. Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-base
(pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,
10 mgm l/C0 1 leupeptin and 2mgm l/C0 1 aprotinin) and clariﬁed lysates were
incubated with 20mg GST-PBD (PAK1 Binding Domain for Rac1 and Cdc42),
GST-RBD (Rhotekin Binding Domain for RhoA) or GST-Rac1G15A (for GEF
trapping assays) beads at 4/C176C for 60 min. After washes, bound proteins were eluted
with Laemmli buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE followed by western blotting.
Microscopy. FRET efﬁciency was represented as the color-coded ratio image of
YFP/CFP after background subtraction using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging).
Some experiments were conducted using a wide-ﬁeld microscope (Axiovert 200,
Carl Zeiss) with a/C2 40 oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). MetaMorph was used for
acquisition with a CoolSNAP HQ camera (Roper Scientiﬁc). The ﬁlters used for the
dual-emission ratio imaging were a 455DRLP dichroic mirror and two emission
ﬁlters, 470AF40 for CFP and 535BP35 for YFP (Chroma Technology Corp).
Cells were illuminated with a 75 W xenon lamp through a 20 nm bandwidth
monochromator Optoscan (CAIRN Research Limited) at 435 nm for CFP
excitation and 500 nm for YFP excitation. The exposure time was 0.5 s with 3/C2 3
binning, every minute. After the ﬁrst acquisition, 0.5mM PtdInsPs were added to
the cells. Other FRET experiments were performed with a confocal microscope
LSM 780 piloted by the Zen software, using a/C2 40 Plan-Apochromat water
immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired with a pinhole diameter
of 149mm.
For immunoﬂuorescence, cells were ﬁxed/permeabilized for 20 min in 3.7%
formaldehyde with 0.05% TritonX100 and saturated in 1% fatty acid free BSA/PBS.
Incubation with antibodies or the GST-2xPHD probe (40mgm l/C0 1 in 1% BSA/PBS)
was performed for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with ﬂuorescent
secondary antibodies or AlexaFluor-labelled phalloidin (Molecular Probes), cells
were washed with PBS and mounted with Mowiol. Confocal imaging was
performed using a LSM 710 or 780 microscope, piloted by Zen software, with a
/C2 63 Plan-Neoﬂuar objective (Carl Zeiss). Proﬁling of ﬂuorescence intensity was
done with ImageJ.
Phospholipid extraction and analysis. Phospholipids were extracted and
analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after metabolic
labelling with [32P]orthophosphate (200mCi ml/C0 1; Perkin Elmer), except for
PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P that were quantiﬁed by mass assay as described13,14,24.
Brieﬂy, total lipid extraction was performed according to the Bligh and Dyer
procedure59. PtdInsP were then puriﬁed by thin layer chromatography. Lipid
kinase assays were performed using recombinant PIKfyve (for PtdIns3P) and PI5P
4-kinase IIa (for PtdIns5P) and [g-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer). The radioactive
biphosphates generated (proportional to the PtdIns3P or PtdIns5P present in the
sample) were extracted and analysed by HPLC.
Lipid–protein overlay assay (fat blots). Recombinant GST-tagged proteins were
expressed inE.coli strain BL21(DE3) and puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography using
glutathione Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(GE Healthcare). PIP-Strips (Echelon Biosciences Inc) and in-house membranes
were used as previously described60. Membranes were blocked in TBS or PBS
containing 3 mg ml/C0 1 FA-free BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Incubations were done
with 0.5mgm l/C0 1 of puriﬁed protein in blocking buffer. After washes, binding of
the domains to the PIs was detected by anti-GST western blotting.
Liposome-binding assays. The liposome-binding assays were performed
essentially as previously described61. Brieﬂy, liposomes containing PC:PE (50:50)
or PC:PE:PtdInsP(n) (45:45:10) were prepared by mixing chloroform stocks, drying
and resuspending using a bath sonicator in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 100 mM NaCl,
200 mM sucrose and 5 mM EGTA. Liposome sedimentation assays were conducted
using 300mM liposomes and 2mg of GST fusion proteins. All centrifugation steps
were done at 16,000g and 4/C176C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed by
SDS–PAGE and silver staining.
Binding of Rac-His to liposomes. Liposomes containing PC:PE:PE-ﬂuor-
escein:DGS-NTA(Ni) (67:28:2:3) were prepared by mixing chloroform/methanol
stocks, drying and resuspending in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl,
200 mM sucrose and 5 mM EGTA. After vortexing and 10 min equilibration at
room temperature, the suspension was subjected to ﬁve freeze/thaw cycles using
liquid nitrogen and extruded 19 times through 0.1mm polycarbonate ﬁlter using a
hand extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Liposomes were kept at 4/C176C and used within
4 days of their preparation. Increasing concentrations of Rac-His were incubated
with 300mM liposomes for 20 min at room temperature in 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 120 mM Potassium acetate, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. Liposomes
were then pelleted by centrifugation (1 h, 16,000g,2 0/C176C) and the ﬂuorescent
liposome pellet was visualized using a UV lamp. Supernatant and pellet fractions
were analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining (Imperial protein stain,
Thermo scientiﬁc).
Exchange factor activity. Liposomes were prepared as described in the Methods
for ‘Binding of Rac-His to liposomes’ but without sucrose. Liposome compositions
were PC:PE:DGS-NTA(Ni) (67:30:3) and PC:PE:DGS-NTA(Ni):PtdInsP

(61:30:3:6). All incubations were done in 96-well black microplates in a ﬁnal
volume of 100ml. Rac-His (loaded with bodipy FL GDP) (1mM) was incubated
with liposomes (300mM) for 10 min in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2. Then, 100 nM Tiam1 DH-PHc (GST-tag was cleaved with
thrombin) was added for 10 additional minutes. Reaction was started by adding
400mM GTP. Activation of Rac1 was monitored by ﬂuorescence of bodipy
(488/535 nm). Fluorescence intensity was recorded every 15 s for 40 min using a
Varioskan ﬂash spectroﬂuorometer (Thermo scientiﬁc). All measurements were
performed at 30/C176C.
Migration and invasion assays. For transwell experiments, cells were processed
as described18. Brieﬂy, cells were seeded in 24-well plates in transwell chambers
(BD Biosciences). Migration proceeded for 6 h toward a gradient of FBS from the
upper chamber of the transwell insert (without FBS) to the lower chamber (with
10% FBS), where cells were scored. Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) invasion
assay was performed on 20,000 serum-starved cells for 6 h and labelled for 90 min
with 0.5mM CellTracker Orange CMTMR (Life Technologies). After washes, cells
were seeded in labtek chambers and overlaid with Matrigel at 5 mg ml/C0 1,
±100 mM NSC23766 (40mm for Cost and Karpas 299). After 90 min at 37/C176C,
medium containing 10% FBS was added (15% FBS containing 1mg/ml SDF1a for
Cost and Karpas 299 cells). Opticalz sections were taken every 2.5mm starting
from the base and extending 100mm into the Matrigel. A representative image is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. To quantify invasion, CMTMR ﬂuorescent cells
in the sections above 20mm were added and then divided by the sum of cells in all
z sections. Quantiﬁcation was performed using Imaris 6.4.2 software (Bitplane). For
transwell experiments, cells were processed as described18. Brieﬂy, cells were seeded
in 24-well plates in transwell chambers (BD Biosciences). Migration proceeded for
6 h toward a gradient of FBS from the upper chamber of the transwell insert
(without FBS) to the lower chamber (with 10% FBS), where cells were scored, either
after staining with crystal violet or after ﬁxation, permeabilization and DAPI
staining. Representative images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.
ECM degradation assays. Cells were seeded on FITC-gelatin-coated coverslips as
described previously62. For colocalization experiments, cells were ﬁxed, stained and
analysed as described above using a LSM 780 confocal microscope. To quantify
ECM degradation, we determined the percentage of cells that presented areas of
degradation relative to the total number of cells in each condition.
Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay. Cells grown on coverslips were ﬁxed in
3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were
then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, except in the case of PtdIns5P
detection where the coverslips were incubated with GST-2xPHD probe before
incubation with an anti-GST antibody as primary. Hybridization, ligation,
ampliﬁcation and detection were realized according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Olink Bioscience). In brief, secondary antibodies were incubated
in a humidity chamber for 1 h at 37/C176C. Ligation was performed with a ligase-
containing ligation solution for 30 min at 37/C176C. Then, the ampliﬁcation step was
performed with a polymerase-containing ampliﬁcation solution for 1 h and 40 min
at 37/C176C. Coverslips were analysed by confocal imaging using a LSM 780 micro-
scope, piloted by the Zen software, with a/C2 63 Plan-NEOFLUAR objective (Carl
Zeiss). Duolink ﬂuorescent dots were counted using the ‘analyse particles functions’
of the Fiji software.
Statistical analysis. Data are representative of three to ﬁve independent
experiments and provided as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analyses were carried out by
either non-parametric t-test, non-parametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis)
with Dunn’s post test or one samplet-test (for the deviation from mean value in a
control group) using GraphPad PRISM 4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Signiﬁcance was accepted at *Po0.05. The number of cells
analysed in the various experiments presented herein can be found in
Supplementary Table 2.
