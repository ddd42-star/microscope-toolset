SUMMARY
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) critically
modulate adhesion-, growth-, and migration-related
processes. Here, we show that the transmembrane
protein, Nogo-A, inhibits neurite outgrowth and cell
spreading in neurons and Nogo-A-responsive cell
lines via HSPGs. The extracellular, active 180 amino
acid Nogo-A region, named Nogo-A-D20, binds to
heparin and brain-derived heparan sulfate glycos-
aminoglycans (GAGs) but not to the closely related
chondroitin sulfate GAGs. HSPGs are required for
Nogo-A-D20-induced inhibition of adhesion, cell
spreading, and neurite outgrowth, as well as for
RhoA activation. Surprisingly, we show that Nogo-
A-D20 can act via HSPGs independently of its recep-
tor, Sphingosine-1-Phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2).
We thereby identify the HSPG family members syn-
decan-3 and syndecan-4 as functional receptors for
Nogo-A-D20. Finally, we show in explant cultures
ex vivo that Nogo-A-D20 promotes the migration of
neuroblasts via HSPGs but not S1PR2.
INTRODUCTION
Cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are highly
expressed in the mammalian nervous system (Sarrazin et al.,
2011; Yamaguchi, 2001 ). HSPGs regulate various develop-
mental processes ranging from neuroblast migration, axon
growth, and guidance to synapse formation and neuronal con-
nectivity (Inatani et al., 2003; Van Vactor et al., 2006; Yamaguchi,
2001). HSPGs transduce signals originating in the extracellular
matrix (ECM) or act as obligate co-receptors for several morpho-
gens, growth factors, and axon guidance molecules (Bernﬁeld
et al., 1999; Sarrazin et al., 2011). Most studies of HSPGs have
focused on the regulation of survival-, proliferation-, or growth-
promoting cues, e.g., ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) (Sarrazin
et al., 2011), rather than growth-inhibiting and repulsive factors.
To our knowledge, only the repulsive activities of EphrinA3, Slit2,
and S1P have been reported to critically depend on the presence
of cell-surface HSPGs (Hu, 2001; Irie et al., 2008; Strochlic
et al., 2008).
Nogo-A is a major anti-adhesive and neurite growth-inhibitory
protein initially discovered for its role as a myelin-associated
inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS ( Schwab,
2010). In addition to its role in the injured CNS, Nogo-A has
been shown to regulate various developmental and plastic pro-
cesses ranging from synapse formation to neuronal migration
(Kempf and Schwab, 2013; Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014). In
the adult brain, Nogo-A promotes cell motility and the tangential
migration of neuroblasts along the rostral migratory stream
(RMS) by triggering cell-cell repulsion (Rolando et al., 2012). At
hippocampal and cortical synapses, Nogo-A acts as a negative
regulator of long-term potentiation and memory stability (Karls-
son et al., 2016; Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014). However, it is
not known if Nogo-A-evoked cellular responses are modulated
by HSPGs.
In this study, we identiﬁed HSPGs as functional receptors for
the active Nogo-A domain, Nogo-A-D20 (rat amino acid [aa]
544–725) (Oertle et al., 2003 ). We found that Nogo-A- D20
activates RhoA and inhibits cell spreading and neurite
outgrowth via HSPGs, speciﬁcally via the transmembrane
HSPGs, syndecan-3 and syndecan-4. In addition, we show
that Nogo-A-D20 inhibits cell adhesion of neuroblasts in an
HSPG-dependent manner and increases neuroblast chain

migration ex vivo. Our results propose a mechanism by which
Nogo-A-D20 affects cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with
HSPGs independently of the previously characterized Nogo-
A-D20 receptor, Sphingosine-1-Phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)
(Kempf et al., 2014).
RESULTS
Cell-Surface Heparan Sulfate Is Required for
Nogo-A-D20-Induced Inhibition of Cell Spreading
Outgrowth of neurites and spreading of cells, e.g., ﬁbroblasts,
are strongly inhibited by substrates containing Nogo-A or its
active fragment, Nogo-A-D20 (Oertle et al., 2003)( Figure 1A).
To determine a possible role of heparan sulfate (HS), cell-
spreading inhibition was examined upon enzymatic cleavage
of HS. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with heparinase III (HepIII)
signiﬁcantly increased cell spreading by/C2445% on the Nogo-A-
D20-coated culture dishes when compared with the vehicle (sa-
line) control (Figures 1A and 1B). Treatment with heparinase I
(HepI), which cleaves HS at the level ofO-sulfated rather than
non-sulfated or N-sulfated disaccharides (Hovingh and Linker,
1970), resulted in a similar decrease of the Nogo-A-D20 inhibition
but required higher enzyme concentrations (Figure S1A).
If endogenous HS promotes the Nogo-A-D20 inhibitory effects
by directly binding to Nogo-A, excess soluble HS in the culture
medium may act as competitive inhibitor and neutralize Nogo-
A-mediated cell-spreading inhibition. Indeed, acute application
of exogenous HS signiﬁcantly increased cell spreading on a
Nogo-A-D20 substrate when compared with control treatment
(Figures 1A and 1C). Similar effects were also observed when
HS was added to Nogo-A-D20-coated plates and washed prior
to plating the cells, suggesting that Nogo-A-D20-bound HS neu-
tralizes cell-spreading inhibition (Figure S1B).
To conﬁrm the involvement of HS in Nogo-A-D20 signaling,
an HS-deﬁcient mutant CHO cell line, pgsD-677 (Lidholt et al.,
1992), was examined. Due to a mutation in theExt1 gene en-
coding for a glycosyltransferase responsible for HS polymeriza-
tion, pgsD-677 cells do not produce HS (Lidholt et al., 1992).
Whereas wild-type (WT) CHO cells were strongly inhibited in
spreading by Nogo-A-D20, spreading inhibition was almost fully
abolished in the HSPG-deﬁcient pgsD-677 cells (Figures 1D
and 1E). To conﬁrm that these results are effectively due to
the lack of HS, we analyzed cell spreading upon re-expression
of Ext1 in pgsD-677 cells. Indeed, Ext1 re-expression fully
restored Nogo-A-D20-mediated cell-spreading inhibition (Fig-
ures 1 D and 1F). Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface
expression of HSPGs conﬁrmed their absence in pgsD-677
cells and their restoration afterExt1 re-expression, as well as
their partial reduction after HepIII treatment of 3T3 cells
(Figure 1G).
Cell-Surface Heparan Sulfate Is Required for
Nogo-A-D20-Induced Inhibition of Neurite Outgrowth
We examined the functional role of HS in Nogo-A-D20-mediated
inhibition of neurite outgrowth using postnatal day (P) 5–8 mouse
cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) as a neuronal model system.
Notably, CGNs would not adhere if HepIII was applied acutely.
Instead, HepIII was applied 12 hr after plating for a total duration
of 24 hr. Delayed treatment of CGNs with HepIII fully abolished
the growth-inhibitory effect of Nogo-A-D20; neurite outgrowth
was increased by/C2492% when compared with the saline control
(Figures 2A and 2B).
To extend these ﬁndings to other neuronal populations, we
analyzed the effect of HepIII treatment in postnatal dorsal root
ganglion (DRG) neurons and embryonic (E19) cortical neurons.
Similar to CGNs, HepIII treatment fully abolished Nogo-A-D20-
induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in DRG (Figures 2C and
2D) and cortical neurons (Figures 2E and 2F). Together, these
results provide strong evidence for the requirement of HS chains
on the surface of Nogo-A-responsive cells to promote Nogo-A-
D20-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth.
Nogo-A-D20 Binds Heparan Sulfate and Brain-Derived
Glycosaminoglycans
To investigate a possible direct binding of Nogo-A-D20 to HS,
we used an ELISA assay. Biotinylated preparations of HS and
heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS (Bernﬁeld et al., 1999),
were immobilized and tested for T7-tagged Nogo-A-D20 bind-
ing using two different antibodies: an anti-T7 tag and a Nogo-A-
speciﬁc antibody targeting theD20 domain (11c7) (Oertle et al.,
2003). To assess the binding speciﬁcity of Nogo-A-D20 to HS,
three different variants of chondroitin sulfate (CS), another form
of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), were tested in parallel (CS-A,
CS-C, and CS-E). In addition, another inhibitory domain of
Nogo-A, Nogo-66 (rat aa 1,026–1,091), which is known to
interact with a different receptor complex (Kempf and Schwab,
2013), was tested. Importantly, Nogo-66 inhibits neurite
outgrowth but not cell spreading (Kempf and Schwab, 2013).
Recombinant Nogo-66-Fc was detected using an Fc-speciﬁc
antibody. Nogo-A-D20 but not Nogo-66 showed very strong
binding to HS and to heparin and signiﬁcantly less to CS-A,
CS-C, or CS-E (p < 0.001) (Figure 3A). These results were repli-
cated using GAGs extracted from adult rat brains (total GAGs)
treated with HepI/III or chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) to obtain
CS-containing GAGs (CS-GAGs) or HS-containing GAGs (HS-
GAGs), respectively. Consistent with the above results, Nogo-
A-D20 bound total GAGs and HS-GAGs very strongly and
showed signiﬁcantly less binding to CS-GAGs (p < 0.001) (Fig-
ure 3B). No binding of Nogo-66 to total GAGs, HS-GAGs, or
CS-GAGs was observed (Figure 3B). In order to determine
the speciﬁcity of the binding of Nogo-A-D20 to CS-GAGs, we
tested the binding of the control protein, Nogo-A-D21 (rat aa
812–918) (Oertle et al., 2003), to brain-derived GAGs. Nogo-
A-D21 lacks inhibitory activity but is puriﬁed under identical
conditions. No difference in binding was observed between
Nogo-A-D21, total GAGs, HS-GAGs, or CS-GAGs (Figure S2).
Moreover, the absorbance values lie in the same range as
those of Nogo-A-D20 binding to CS-GAGs, suggesting that
the binding of Nogo-A-D20 to CS-GAGs is likely to be non-spe-
ciﬁc. Given the fact that the results inFigures 3B and S2 are
standardized against the total GAGs and that the HS:CS ratio
in the brain is 1:10 (Deepa et al., 2006), Nogo-A-D20 shows a
strong binding preference to HS-GAGs. Together, these results
indicate that the key and main binding partner of Nogo-A-D20
is HS.
Finally, to determine the binding afﬁnity of Nogo-A-D20 to hep-
arin or HS-GAGs, a dose-response binding curve was produced
(Figures 3C and 3D). Binding was saturable, and nonlinear ﬁtting

revealed that Nogo-A-D20 binds to heparin and HS-GAGs with a
dissociation constant (Kd)o f /C24234 nM and/C24562 nM, respec-
tively (Figures 3C and 3D).
To assess the ability of Nogo-A-D20 to bind HS under physio-
logical conditions, cell-surface binding assays were performed
in CHO WT and pgsD-677 cells. Cells were incubated with
HA-tagged Nogo-A-D20 for 1 hr at 4/C14C, washed, and immuno-
stained for the HA tag (Figure 3E). Nogo-A-D20 binding was
assessed by measuring the number of Nogo-A-D20 puncta per
cell-surface area calculated upon 3D reconstruction of the cells.
High numbers of Nogo-A-D20 puncta per WT CHO cell were

found, whereas no binding of Nogo-A-
D20 was detected in CHO pgs-D677 cells
(Figure 3F). Similar results were obtained
in 3T3 cells after HepIII treatment (Fig-
ure 3G), showing that Nogo-A-D20 binds
HSPGs in a physiological setting.
Nogo-A-D20 Acts via HSPGs
Independently of S1PR2
Cell-surface HSPGs can act as co-recep-
tors by promoting the binding of a ligand
to its obligate receptor and thereby
altering its activation (Bernﬁeld et al.,
1999; Sarrazin et al., 2011). Given the prior
identiﬁcation of the G-protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR), S1PR2, as a functional
receptor for Nogo-A-D20 (Kempf et al.,
2014), HSPGs may enhance or allow the
formation of a Nogo-A-D20/S1PR2 com-
plex. Alternatively, HSPGs may transduce
Nogo-A-D20 signals independently of
S1PR2. In the latter case, we reasoned that HepIII treatment of
S1PR2-deﬁcient cells should show a disinhibition effect; in the
former case, no effect of HepIII should be observed given the
requirement of S1PR2 as obligate receptor. To test this,
S1PR2/C0//C0mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) (Kempf et al.,
2014) were treated with HepIII or saline and plated on Nogo-A-
D20. Strikingly, treatment of S1PR2/C0//C0MEFs with HepIII signiﬁ-
cantly further increased cell spreading on Nogo-A-D20 when
compared with HepIII-treated WT MEFs or S1PR2/C0//C0MEFs
alone (Figures 4A and S3A). This suggests that Nogo-A-D20
can act via HSPGs independently of S1PR2.
Developmental Cell43, 24–34, October 9, 201727
In CHO-K1 WT cells, the levels of endogenous S1PRs’ mRNAs
were shown to be below detection limit, and these cells were
unresponsive to the S1PR family ligand S1P in a variety of
in vitroassays (e.g.,Gonda et al., 1999; Okamoto et al., 1998).
Based on these observations, CHO-K1 WT cells are considered
as devoid of S1PR expression. To validate this under our
experimental conditions, CHO WT cells were treated with the
pharmacological S1PR2 antagonist, JTE-013, and plated onto
Nogo-A-D20 and control substrates (Figures 4B and S3B). As
expected, JTE-013 did not antagonize Nogo-A-D20-dependent
inhibition of cell spreading (Figures 4B and S3B), suggesting
that Nogo-A-D20 can exert inhibitory effects via HSPGs in
S1PR2-deﬁcient cellular systems. Also, JTE-013 did not antago-
nize Nogo-A- D20-dependent inhibition of cell spreading in
mutant pgsD-677 cells (Figures 4B andS3B).
Nogo-A-D20 has been repeatedly shown to activate the
RhoA/ROCK pathway and thereby to inhibit cell spreading
and neurite outgrowth (Kempf et al., 2014; Niederost et al.,
2002). To test whether HSPGs can also mediate Nogo-A-
D20-induced downstream signaling, RhoA activation was
measured in CHO WT and pgsD-677 cells. In CHO WT cells,
a /C24250% increase in RhoA activation was observed 20 min
after application of Nogo-A- D20, whereas no change was
observed in pgsD-677 cells (Figures 4C and 4D). The inactive
Nogo-A fragment Nogo-A-D21 was used as control protein.
Further, no change in RhoA activation was observed in the
presence of JTE-013 (Figure S4), suggesting the presence of
an S1PR2-independent, HSPG-dependent Nogo-A-D20 signal
transduction pathway.
To determine whether Nogo-A-D20 inhibition in CHO WT cells
could be overcome by blocking RhoA or the downstream Rho-
associated kinase (ROCK), CHO WT cell were treated with the
RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase, or with the ROCK inhibitor,
Y-27632, and plated onto Nogo-A-D20. In line with the RhoA
activation results, blockade of RhoA or ROCK showed a full
rescue of Nogo-A-D20 inhibition (Figures 4E and 4F).
Finally, in order to determine the effect of simultaneous
blockade of HSPGs and S1PR2 in cells co-expressing
HSPGs and S1PR2, 3T3 cells were treated with HepIII and/or
JTE-013 and assessed in a cell-spreading assay. Strikingly,
blockade of HSPGs and S1PR2 showed an additive effect
in reducing Nogo-A-D20-induced inhibition of cell spreading

(Figures S3C and S3D). Hence, in cells co-expressing both re-
ceptors, Nogo-A- D20 can exert inhibitory effects via both
S1PR2 as well as HSPGs. However, as shown by using
S1PR2-deﬁcient cells, HSPGs are themselves sufﬁcient to
mediate Nogo-A-D20 inhibition and RhoA activation.

Spreading and Neurite Outgrowth

families: syndecans and glypicans (Bernﬁeld et al., 1999). As

opposed to syndecans, glypicans are
attached by a glycosylphosphatidylinosi-
tol anchor to the membrane and do not
exert cytoplasmic signaling roles (Bern-
ﬁeld et al., 1999). The syndecan family
consists of four members: syndecan-1
to syndecan-4 (Sdc1–Sdc4) ( Bernﬁeld
et al., 1999), of which syndecan-4 is the
most highly expressed in 3T3 cells (Fig-
ure 5 A). Interestingly, syndecan-4 has
been shown to activate RhoA to promote
focal adhesion maturation and stress ﬁber
assembly following engagement with
ﬁbronectin (Brooks et al., 2012; Dovas
et al., 2006).
To test the contribution of syndecan-4
to Nogo-A-D20-induced inhibition of cell
spreading and RhoA activation, synde-
can-4 was knocked down using lenti-
virus-delivered control and syndecan-4
shRNA (Figure S5A). Strikingly, knock-
down of syndecan-4 fully prevented
Nogo-A-D20 inhibition of cell spreading (Figures 5B and 5C).
To test if Nogo-A-D20 activates RhoA via syndecan-4, RhoA
activation assays were performed in control versus syndecan-4
shRNA cells. The inactive Nogo-A fragment, Nogo-A-D21, was
used as control protein. No RhoA activation was observed
upon syndecan-4 knockdown (Figure 5G). Together, these re-
sults suggest that Nogo-A-D20 inhibits cell spreading by acti-
vating RhoA via syndecan-4 in ﬁbroblasts.
To investigate whether syndecans are also important in Nogo-
A-D20-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth, we ﬁrst assessed
Developmental Cell43, 24–34, October 9, 201729
their expression in DIV4 E19 rat cortical neurons and found syn-
decan-3 to be the most highly expressed (Figure 5D). Remark-
ably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of syndecan-3 fully prevented
outgrowth inhibition on the Nogo-A-D20 substrate (Figures 5E,
5F, andS5B).
Further, to test whether syndecan-3 and syndecan-4
directly interact with Nogo-A-D20, microscale thermophoresis
binding experiments were performed using recombinant syn-
decan-3 and syndecan-4 proteins. We found that Nogo-A-
D20 binds to syndecan-3 and syndecan-4 in a similar afﬁnity
range as it binds to brain-derived HS-GAGs with a Kd of
/C24865.7 nM and /C24522.1 nM, respectively (Figure 5H). Taken
together, these data show that Nogo-A- D20 binds to and
exerts inhibitory effects via syndecan-3 or -4 in a cell-type-
speciﬁc manner.
Nogo-A-D20 Promotes Neuroblast Migration via HSPGs
Nogo-A-D20 was shown to promote the tangential migration of
neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the olfactory
bulb along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) through activation
of the Rho/ROCK pathway (Rolando et al., 2012). Yet, no molec-
ular basis for this observation was found, and we sought to
determine the physiological relevance of the Nogo-A- D20/
HSPG interaction in this process.
To investigate the contribution of HSPGs to SVZ-derived neu-
roblast migration, postnatal explants of the SVZ and RMS were
used as anex vivo model (Wichterle et al., 1997) and treated
with HepIII and/or the Nogo-A-D20 function-blocking antibody
11c7. In this assay, neuroblasts move out of the explant core
by chain migration (i.e., associated with each other) as occurs
in the RMSin vivo(Wichterle et al., 1997). As previously shown,
Nogo-A neutralization by 11c7 induced a signiﬁcant reduction of
the migration area (Figures 6A and 6B). HepIII treatment induced
a similar reduction of the migration (Figures 6A and 6B). To
examine whether HSPGs and Nogo-A-D20 operate through the
same pathway, we co-administered HepIII and 11c7. Co-appli-
cation of HepIII and 11c7 led to a reduction in migration area
similar to that obtained upon treatment of HepIII or 11c7 alone
(Figures 6A and 6B), suggesting that Nogo-A-D20 operates
through HSPGs in this system.
Previous data suggested that Nogo-A sustains neuroblast
migration by providing anti-adhesive signals (Rolando et al.,
2012). To investigate whether HSPGs participate in Nogo-A-
D20-mediated repulsive effects, we asked whether HepIII
treatment affected neuroblast adhesion on control versus
Nogo-A-D20-coated substrates in the presence or absence of
11c7. HepIII treatment signiﬁcantly increased cell adhesion on
Nogo-A-D20 to a similar extent to 11c7 (Figure 6C). No additive
or synergistic effects were observed (Figure 6C), suggesting that
Nogo-A-D20 and HSPGs share a common pathway inex vivo
cultures.
Finally, to test the role of the previously identiﬁed Nogo-A-
D20 receptor S1PR2 in neuroblast migration, explants were
treated with the S1PR2 blocker, JTE-013, or DMSO (vehicle
control). No signiﬁcant effect on the migration area was
observed using different concentrations of JTE-013 (Figures
6D and 6E). Similarly, JTE-013 treatment had no effect on
neuroblast adhesion (Figure 6F). Taken together, these data
show that Nogo-A-D20 inhibits adhesion and increases migra-
tion by providing anti-adhesive signals through HSPGs but
not S1PR2.
DISCUSSION
Cell-to-cell signaling by ligand receptor interactions as well as in-
teractions with ECM constituents play key roles during develop-
mental processes such as neuronal migration and axon growth.
In this study, we identify a biochemical interaction between the
membrane protein Nogo-A and HSPGs and demonstrate its
functional signiﬁcance in cell spreading, neurite outgrowth,
adhesion, and neuroblast chain migration.
Cell-surface HSPGs are traditionally viewed as co-receptors
that promote the binding of a ligand to its obligate receptor
through their large glycosaminoglycan chains (Bernﬁeld et al.,
1999; Sarrazin et al., 2011) but do not act as signal-transducing
receptors themselves. In the case of FGF and many other mor-
phogens, HS is essential for the ligand/receptor complex to
form and to alter its activation (Sarrazin et al., 2011). Surprisingly,
our data suggest that this is not the case for Nogo-A-D20 and its
S1PR2 receptor (Kempf et al., 2014): Nogo-A-D20 can activate
RhoA in S1PR-negative CHO cells and inhibits cell spreading
in S1PR2/C0//C0MEFs. Hence, our results strongly suggest that
Nogo-A-D20 can signal through S1PR-independent mecha-
nisms. However, when HSPGs and S1PR2 are co-expressed,
both pathways can act in parallel, as shown for ﬁbroblasts, or
one pathway can gain control of the signaling output, as demon-
strated for neuroblasts. Collectively, our experiments reveal that
more than one receptor for the active Nogo-A-D20 region exists
and that Nogo-A-D20-induced inhibitory effects are regulated in
a cell-type-speciﬁc manner.
Based on our ﬁndings showing the involvement of syndecan-
3 and syndecan-4, we may hypothesize that the cytoplasmic
tail of syndecans is important for Nogo-A-D20-induced signal
transduction upon extracellular binding to the HS chains. A
few studies have shown that transmembrane syndecans can
act as signaling receptors through their cytoplasmic domains.
During cell migration, engagement of syndecan-4 by ﬁbronectin
was shown to result in the activation of protein kinase C a
(PKCa) upstream of RhoA activation (Bass et al., 2007, 2008;
Brooks et al., 2012; Dovas et al., 2006). Even though it is un-
clear how syndecan-4 signals to RhoA via PKCa, PKCa was
shown to activate RhoA via phosphorylation of the Rho guanine
exchange factor (RhoGEF), p115, in a different system (Peng
et al., 2011). It will be interesting to investigate if Nogo-A-D20
operates via similar mechanisms. In the case of syndecan-3,
binding of the heparin-binding growth-associated molecule
(HB-GAM) was shown to result in phosphorylation of the Src
kinases, c-Src and c-Fyn, and of cortactin, which promotes
polymerization and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton re-
sulting in neurite outgrowth (Kinnunen et al., 1998). A similar
mechanism was proposed for glial cell line-derived neurotro-
phic factor (GDNF) family ligands and syndecan-3 (Bespalov
et al., 2011). However, no link between syndecan-3 and RhoA
activation has been reported so far and future studies will
address this point.
Syndecan-3 is the major HSPG found in neurons of the
developing brain and shows abundant expression in major
axonal tracts and migratory routes, e.g., in the RMS (Hienola

et al., 2006; Nolo et al., 1995; Rauvala et al., 2000). In the adult
brain, syndecan-3 is strongly expressed in the hippocampus,
cerebellum, and cortex, and in several axonal tracts (Hsueh
and Sheng, 1999). Our results show that the anti-adhesive ef-
fect of Nogo-A-D20 is accompanied by an HS-dependent in-
crease in neuroblast chain mig ration. Notably, syndecan-

et al., 2006; Mathis et al., 2010; Mingorance-Le Meur et al.,
2007; Rolando et al., 2012). Syndecan-3/C0//C0mice also display
a synaptic plasticity phenotype similar to that observed in
Nogo-A/C0//C0mice, increasing CA1 l ong-term potentiation
(LTP) while baseline transmission and short-term plasticity
are not affected ( Kaksonen et al., 2002 ). Given the recent
implication of HSPGs in synapse formation and plasticity
(Allen et al., 2012; de Wit et al., 2013; Siddiqui et al., 2013),
it will be interesting to determine if Nogo-A also mediates its
effects on synapse formation and plasticity via HSPGs (Miro-
nova and Giger, 2013). Overall, the localization of syndecan
proteins and their physiological impact in the developing
and adult brain are consistent with a functional interaction
between Nogo-A and HSPGsin vivo.
In conclusion, our study shows that Nogo-A-D20 regulates
adhesion, cell spreading, outgrowth, and migration of various
cell lines, neurons, and neuroblasts by interacting with trans-
membrane HSPGs.

Primary Neuronal Cultures and Explants
Postnatal day 5-8 (P5-8) mouse cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), P5-8 mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and embryonic
day 19 (E19) rat cortical neurons were maintained in Neurobasal-A medium (GIBCO) supplemented with GlutaMAX (GIBCO), Peni-
cillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep) (1x; GIBCO), B-27 (1x; GIBCO) and 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Mouse CGNs and DRGs were prepared
from C57/BL6 mice pups. Rat cortical neurons were prepared from Wistar rat embryos.
Mouse P5 neuroblast explants were prepared from C57/BL6 mice pups. Tissues from the SVZ and RMS were embedded in 75%
Matrigel growth factor reduced (BD Biosciences) and maintained in Neurobasal medium (GIBCO) supplemented with Glutamine
(0.5 mM; Invitrogen), Pen/Strep (20 U/ml; Sigma) and B-27 (1x; Miltenyi).
SVZ cells were dissociated from adult C57/BL6 mice SVZs and maintained in DMEM/F-12 (GIBCO) supplemented with B-27
(1x; Miltenyi).
All primary cells were cultured at 37/C14C and 5% CO2.
Cell Lines
Swiss 3T3 (ATCC) cells and primary mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle medium
(DMEM) (GIBCO) containing 10% neonatal calf serum (Invitrogen). MEFs were prepared from S1PR2-/- or littermate wild-type
(WT) E14-E16 embryos. CHO K1 WT (ATCC) and CHO pgsD-677 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). HEK293T (ATCC) cells were maintained in Iscove’s Modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) (Life Technolo-
gies) supplemented with 4 mM L-Glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (GIBCO) and 10% FBS (Invitrogen).
All cell lines were cultured at 37/C14C and 5% CO2.
METHOD DETAIL
Constructs and Protein Expression
BL21/DE3 E. coliwere transformed with the pET28 expression vector (Novagen) containing His-/T7-tagged Nogo-A-D20 (rat aa 544-
725), His-/T7-tagged Nogo-A-D21 (rat aa 812-918) or His-/HA-tagged Nogo-A-D20 (Oertle et al., 2003). Bacteria were cultured at
37/C14C to reach an OD of 0.6 AU. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 M IPTG for 2 h at 30/C14C. Fusion proteins were puriﬁed
using Co2+-Talon Metal Afﬁnity Resin (Takara Bio Inc.).
Brain-Derived Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
Adult Sprague Dawley rats were sacriﬁced and decapitated. The brains were cut into smaller pieces before de-lipidation with cold
acetone. The tissues were then dried and homogenized in cold pronase buffer. The brain was then treated with pronase overnight and
the proteins/peptides were removed by precipitation using trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation. The residual trichloroace-
tic acid retained in the supernatant (which contains the GAGs) was removed with 5 diethyl ether washes. The GAGs were precipitated
with sodium acetate and absolute ethanol overnight at 4/C14C and recovered after centrifugation. The resulting pellet was reconstituted
in 500ml of de-ionized water and stored at -20/C14C.
Spinal Cord Protein Extracts
One adult Wister rat was sacriﬁced and decapitated. The spinal cord was dissected and immediately homogenized using ice-cold
extraction buffer (3.7% CHAPS, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM PMSF) containing protease inhibitors (EDTA-free Complete
Mini, Roche). Homogenized tissue was incubated for 30 min on ice and ultracentrifuged at 170’000g for 1 h at 4/C14C. Supernatant was
aliquoted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The concentration was determined using a Bradford assay.
MEF Isolation
Primary WT and S1PR2-/- MEFs were prepared from E14-E16 embryos. The mother was sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation and
embryos were isolated. Heads and dark organs were removed and used for genotyping. The rest of the embryos was cut into small
pieces and enzymatically digested using 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Post-digestion, the tissue was resus-
pended in DMEM and pipetted through a 40mM ﬁlter to obtain single cells. MEFs were expanded and frozen.
Immunocytochemistry
Cell Lines and primary cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min, washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100. After blocking with 2% goat serum (Invitrogen), cells were ﬁrst incubated with the primary antibodies for 30 min at room tem-
perature and detected using corresponding secondary antibodies in 2% goat serum.
For cell-surface immunocytochemical detection of Nogo-A-D20, cells were ﬁrst incubated with 1mM HA-tagged Nogo-A-D20 and
subsequently with anti-HA antibodies for 1 h each on ice in serum-free medium containing 0.02% sodium azide (Sigma). Cells were
washed, ﬁxed with 1% PFA and stained with secondary antibodies. Image stacks were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal micro-
scope equipped with a 63x oil immersion objective (NA 1.4). Stacks were reconstructed in 3D with Imaris (Bitplane) and the cell-sur-
face area was measured for each cell. Bound Nogo-A-D20 puncta were counted using the spot function of Imaris and the total
number was normalized to the cell-surface area for each cell. The average ratio obtained with secondary antibody only controls
was baseline-subtracted from each cell.
Developmental Cell43, 24–34.e1–e5, October 9, 2017e3
Flow Cytometry
For FACS analysis, non-ﬁxed cells were detached using 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), washed 1x in PBS, washed 2x in Tris-
Buffer/1%BSA at 4/C14C and stained with the indicated primary antibodies followed by ﬂuorescently-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 30 min each in Tris-Buffer/5% BSA on ice. Cells were immediately analyzed by FACS (BD Canto II). FACS staining was quantitated
using the FlowJo (Tree Star Inc) software. The ﬂuorescence intensity is displayed on the X-axis (divided into 256 bins). The % of Max
on the Y-axis represents the number of cells in each bin on the X-axis (FlowJo uses an arbitrary number of 256 bins) divided by the
number of cells in the bin that contains the largest number of cells.
RhoA Activation Assays
3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated for 20 min with 1mM Nogo-A-D20 or Nogo-A-D21 control protein. Pulldown of
activated RhoA-GTP was subsequently performed using the RhoA Activation Assay Biochem Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Alternatively, RhoA activation was assessed using the total RhoA ELISA and RhoA G-LISA kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Levels of activated RhoA were normalized to total RhoA levels
for each biological replicate.
Generation of Stable Cell Lines
Mission shRNA (Sigma) pLKO lentiviral plasmids containing shRNA against mouse syndecan-4 (TRCN0000331554) and non-target
shRNA (SHC202 (TRC2 vector)) were transfected into HEK293T cells using PEI (polyethyleimine) 25 kDa (Polysciences Inc.). Lenti-
viruses were concentrated from ﬁltered culture media by ultracentrifugation at 25000 rpm for 2 h. Swiss 3T3 cells stably expressing
ctrl shRNA and Sdc4 shRNA were selected with 4mg/mL puromycin. Quantiﬁcation of the respective mRNA knockdown was
performed by qRT-PCR.
Cell Spreading and Neurite Outgrowth Assays
Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblast spreading assays and neurite outgrowth assays were performed as follows. 4-well plates (Greiner) were coated
with 40-100 pmol/cm2 (0.4-1 mM) Nogo-A-D20 or Nogo-A-D21 (control protein) or 5mg/cm2 myelin at 4/C14C overnight. In outgrowth
experiments, wells were precoated with 0.3mg/ml Poly-L-Lysine (PLL; Sigma) for 1 h at 37/C14C before the addition of the different
substrates. Unbound material was removed by 3 washes with PBS.
Cell lines were detached with 2% (w/v) EDTA (Invitrogen) in PBS and plated at 7000 cells per cm2 for 1 h, ﬁxed with 4% PFA and
stained with Phalloidin-Alexa488. For HepI and HepIII (Sigma) treatment, cells were incubated with 2.5 U/ml HepIII or 2.5-10 U/ml
HepI 3 h prior to plating and during the spreading assay. Higher concentrations of HepIII could not be used under our experimental
conditions because of their effects on cell viability. For JTE-013 (Tocris), Y-27632 (Sigma) and cell-permeable C3 transferase (CT04,
Cytoskeleton), cells were incubated with 1mM JTE-013, 5mM Y-27632 or 100mg/ml C3 30 min prior to plating and during the
spreading assay. The corresponding solvents or isotype antibodies were used as controls. For expression of EXT1 in pgsD-677 cells,
pgsD-677 cells were transfected with pcDNA5-Ext1 or mock-transfected with pcDNA5(-) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions 48 h prior to replating. For shRNA experiments, Swiss 3T3 cells stably expressing
ctrl and Sdc4 shRNA were plated onto Nogo-A-D20 or Nogo-A-D21 substrates in the presence of 4mg/mL puromycin.
The percentage of cells that remained round, i.e. did not spread, was quantiﬁed manually in four randomly chosen areas of the well/
coverslip and averaged over those areas (n = 1 coverslip). Data of all coverslips were normalized to the control values of coverslip #1
in experiment #1 and plotted as mean ± SEM from multiple coverslips.
CGNs were plated at 7.5x104 cells per cm2, DRGs at 7.5x103 cells per cm2 and cortical neurons at 5x104 cells per cm2 onto the
various substrates. Neurons were ﬁxed with 4% PFA and stained with anti-bIII Tubulin (CGNs and DRGs) or Mab1b (cortical neurons).
Treatment of CGNs with 500 mU/ml HepIII and DRGs with 1 U/ml HepIII started 12 h post-plating for 24 h. Cortical neurons were
treated at DIV4 with 1 U/ml HepIII for 3 h and replated for 24 h in the presence of HepIII. The corresponding solvents were used
as control. For siRNA experiments, E19 rat cortical neurons were plated at 0.6x106 cells in 6-well plates coated with 0.3 mg PLL
and transfected at DIV4 with 50 nM siRNA using DharmaFECT 3 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3 days post-transfection, neurons were detached with 0.25% Trypsin and replated on a Nogo-A-D20 or control substrate for 24 h.
Neurons were imaged with an Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-NEOFLUAR 10X/NA 0.3 objective in a semi-
automated procedure. Mean total neurite length per cell was quantiﬁed using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) in four
randomly chosen areas of the well/coverslip and averaged over those areas (n = 1 coverslip). Data of all coverslips were normalized
to the control values of coverslip #1 in experiment #1 and plotted as mean ± SEM from multiple coverslips.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using TacMan Reverse Transcription Reagents
(Applied Biosystems). cDNA was ampliﬁed using the Light Cycler 480 thermocycler (Roche) with the polymerase ready mix (SYBR
Green I Master, Roche). Relative quantiﬁcation was performed using the comparative CT method. cDNA levels were normalized to
the reference genes Gapdh and Rpl19 (mouse) or Gapdh and eF1a1 (rat). Each reaction was completed in triplicate. Melting curve
analysis of PCR products followed by gel electrophoresis was performed to verify amplicons.

ELISA
The ELISA was modiﬁed according to the method described in (Purushothaman et al., 2007). Biotinylated GAGs (0.5mg per well) were
immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated 384-well-plate (Pierce/Thermo scientiﬁc). Biotinylation of GAGs was performed by EDC and
biotin-LC-hydrazide conjugation (Pierce/Thermo Scientiﬁc). After biotinylated GAGs were immobilized on the plates, the plates were
blocked in 1% BSA and subjected to the binding of recombinant Nogo-66-Fc, Nogo-A-D20-T7 or Nogo-A-D21-T7. The bound Nogo
variants were then recognized by the anti-T7, anti-Fc or 11C7 antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected using anti-mouse-
alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies followed by a direct measurement of absorbance at 405 nm using p-nitrophenylphos-
phate (Sigma Aldrich). BSA only control (no recombinant proteins) measurements were used as baseline in every experiment and
subtracted from the other readings. For quantiﬁcation, the mean ± SEM of absorbance measurements was determined from three
experiments.
Explant Assay
Antibodies and compounds were mixed with Matrigel: 11c7 (Oertle et al., 2003), 1mg/ml; mouse anti-human IgG, 1mg/ml (Jackson
ImmunoResearch); HepIII, 500 mU/ml (Sigma); JTE-013, 250 nM, 500 nM or 2mM (Tocris). Only vital explants with cells moving
out of the tissue core in chains were analyzed. Explants were ﬁxed in 4% PFA for 40 min and stained using DAPI to visualize cell nuclei
or labeled usingbIII Tubulin or Doublecortin antibodies (Rolando et al., 2012) to mark neuroblasts. Migration data were normalized to
the control group for each experiment and plotted as mean ± SEM from multiple experiments.
Adhesion Assay
SVZ-cells were either plated on poly-D-lysine (PDL) only or Nogo-A–D20-coated coverslips (12,000 cells/cm2)( Rolando et al., 2012).
Glass coverslips (1cm2) were ﬁrst coated with PDL (5mg/ml) and then with Nogo-A–D20 (100 pmol/cm2). Cells were pre-incubated
with HepIII and/or 11c7 or with JTE-013 for 30 min and subsequently plated for 1 h. Cells were ﬁxed, stained with DAPI and forbIII
Tubulin and scored. The average number of adhered cells was determined by counting in ﬁve randomly chosen ﬁelds of view of the
coverslips. Data of all coverslips were normalized to the control values of coverslip #1 in experiment #1 and plotted as mean ± SEM
from multiple coverslips.
Microscale Thermophoresis
Microscale thermophoresis ligand binding measurements were performed using a Nanotemper Monolith NT.115 (Nano Temper
technologies) (Wienken et al., 2010; Zillner et al., 2012). Recombinant Nogo-A–D20 was ﬂuorescently labelled using the Amine Reac-
tive Protein labelling kit, RED. A constant concentration of Nogo-A–D20 (40nM) was incubated with the different serially diluted
recombinant proteins in PBS containing 0.025% Tween-20 at pH 7.4. 3-5ml of each sample was loaded into a hydrophilic glass capil-
lary (Nano Temper technologies) and thermophoresis analysis was performed (LED 60%, IR laser 20%) (Wienken et al., 2010; Zillner
et al., 2012). MST data were normalized for baseline differences between 3 runs andKd values were calculated using nonlinear
regression assuming a Hill coefﬁcient of 1.0 (GraphPad Prism).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software GraphPad Prism 5 or 6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). *p < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Calculations were corrected for multiple comparisons as speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends.
