In brief
How do epithelia dynamically maintain
their integrity in a constantly changing
environment? Gagliardi et al. show that
apoptotic cells trigger ERK/Akt waves in
their neighboring cells inducing survival
for 3–4 h. At the cell population scale, this
mechanism dynamically protects the
epithelium from mild to acute
environmental insults.

SUMMARY
Cell death events continuously challenge epithelial barrier function yet are crucial to eliminate old or critically
damaged cells. How such apoptotic events are spatio-temporally organized to maintain epithelial homeosta-
sis remains unclear. We observe waves of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT serine/thre-
onine kinase (Akt) activity pulses that originate from apoptotic cells and propagate radially to healthy
surrounding cells. This requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) signaling. At the single-cell level, ERK/Akt waves act as spatial survival signals that locally protect
cells in the vicinity of the epithelial injury from apoptosis for a period of 3–4 h. At the cell population level,
ERK/Akt waves maintain epithelial homeostasis (EH) in response to mild or intense environmental insults.
Disruption of this spatial signaling system results in the inability of a model epithelial tissue to ensure barrier
function in response to environmental insults.
INTRODUCTION
An epithelium is a self-organizing tissue that coordinates cell di-
vision and death to maintain its barrier function. This ability, called
epithelial homeostasis (EH), is especially important because of
the frequent apoptosis observed in epithelia ( Darwich et al.,
2014). EH depends on cell density sensing, epithelial extrusion,
spindle orientation, apoptotic-neighbor communication, and
cell-cell adhesion dynamics to maintain epithelial integrity ( Mac-
ara et al., 2014 ). Coordination between epithelial extrusion and
cell division is crucial to maintain an adequate cell density ( Eisen-
hoffer et al., 2012; Gudipaty et al., 2017; Marinari et al., 2012). Co-
ordination of apoptotic cells with healthy neighboring cells is
essential to close the gaps caused by extrusion of dying cells (Ga-
gliardi et al., 2018 ; Gu et al., 2011 ).
Apoptosis can control the fate of neighboring cells. Mitogenic
factors produced by apoptotic cells induce proliferation in neigh-
boring cells, enabling wound repair (Li et al., 2010 ). Apoptotic
cells can however also induce further apoptosis in neighboring
cells during developmental processes that require coordinated
cell death (Pe´ rez-Garijo et al., 2013 ). Apoptosis can trigger sur-
vival fates in surrounding healthy cells in the Drosophila wing
imaginal disk ( Bilak et al., 2014 ). These different processes imply
coordination of signaling pathways that regulate proliferation,
survival, or apoptosis fates. However, how these signaling path-
ways are regulated at the single-cell level and spatio-temporally
integrated at the population level remains poorly understood.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-
regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/
Akt signaling networks are crucial for regulation of cell fate.
Recent evidence has shown that ERK/Akt signaling dynamics
ﬁne-tune fate decisions at the single-cell level. In epithelial cells,
discrete ERK activity pulses of ﬁxed amplitude and duration are
observed at the single-cell level ( Albeck et al., 2013 ). The ERK
pulse frequency depends on the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
concentration, which further correlates with the efﬁciency of
cell-cycle entry. These ERK pulses emerge from the three-tiered
Raf/MEK/ERK network structure with negative feedback from
ERK to Raf ( Albeck et al., 2013 ; Ryu et al., 2015 ; Santos et al.,
2007) that provide ultrasensitivity and adaptation properties to
shape their pulsatile dynamics. In addition to ERK pulses, Akt
pulses that are synchronous with the latter have been observed
in epithelial cells ( Sampattavanich et al., 2018 ). These Akt pulses
are thought to maintain metabolic stability in epithelia ( Hung
et al., 2017 ). Beyond the relationship that links EGF dose and
proliferation fate, little is known about how ERK/Akt regulates
additional single-cell fate decisions, such as survival or
apoptosis, and how the latter are integrated at the cell population
level to ensure EH.
Here, we show that apoptosis triggers a wave of ERK/Akt ac-
tivity pulses that radially propagates for about three healthy cell
layers. This signaling wave requires EGFR and MMP activity and
acts as a survival signal that locally protects cells from apoptosis
for a period of 3–4 h. This single-cell behavior maintains

RESULTS
Collective ERK/Akt activity waves propagate from
apoptotic cells in quiescent unstimulated epithelium
To investigate single-cell ERK/Akt activity dynamics in epithelia,
we stably transduced MCF10A cells with histone 2B (H2B), ERK-
KTR ( Regot et al., 2014 ) and 1–396 Forkhead box O3 (FoxO3a)
tagged with miRFP703 ( Shcherbakova et al., 2016 ), mTur-
quoise2 ( Goedhart et al., 2012 ), and mNeonGreen ( Shaner
et al., 2013 )( Figure S1 A). ERK-KTR and FoxO3a biosensors
respectively report single-cell ERK and Akt activity by displaying
reversible nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation upon phosphoryla-
tion ( Figures S1 A and S1B). While FoxO3a can be sensitive to
ERK-dependent inputs, this has been shown to be negligible in
MCF10A cells (Sampattavanich et al., 2018 ). We developed an
automated image analysis pipeline to segment/track nuclei and
to extract cytosolic/nuclear (C/N) ﬂuorescence intensities that
quantify ERK/Akt activities (Figure S1 C). As previously shown
(Albeck et al., 2013 ; Sampattavanich et al., 2018 ), starved
MCF10A cells showed synchronous ERK and Akt activity pulses
whose frequency increased with EGF stimulation ( Figure 1 A).
The amplitudes of both ERK/Akt pulses were similar with or
without EGF ( Figure S1 D). Visual examination ( Figure 1 B), as
well as spatial clustering of trajectories ( Figure 1 C), revealed
that starved monolayers display collective ERK/Akt activity in
the form of radial waves.
These ERK/Akt activity waves originated from single apoptotic
cells and radially propagated in a healthy neighborhood through
sequential triggering of an ERK/Akt activity pulse in each succes-
sive cell layer ( Figures 1 D–1F; Video S1 ). In the ﬁrst layer, ERK/
Akt activity increased synchronously with apoptotic nuclear
shrinkage and peaked at 10–15 min after this event (Figures
1G and S1E). In the second and third cell layers, delayed ERK/
Akt activity peaked at 15–20 and 20–30 min, respectively. An
apoptotic cell could trigger ERK/Akt activity in 0 to 35 neighbors,
with a median of 6 ( Figure 1H). Less than 5% of apoptotic events
failed to trigger ERK/Akt ( Figure S1 F). The proportion of pulsing
neighbors decreased across the layers; about 90% in the 1st,
30% in the 2nd, and 10% in the 3rd ( Figure 1 I). Further, ERK
pulse amplitude in pulsing cells remained constant in the 1st
and 2nd layer but signiﬁcantly reduced in the third layer (Fig-
ure 1 J). MCF10A cells are classically cultured in presence of
cholera toxin ( Debnath et al., 2003 ). We found that the latter
altered ERK/Akt waves by reducing the apoptotic rate, wave
size, and global ERK activity (Figures S1 G–S1I). We therefore
performed our experiments in absence of cholera toxin to avoid
this confounding effect.
These results show that apoptotic cells induce radially propa-
gating ERK/Akt waves in neighboring healthy cells.
ERK waves also occur in MDCK and NRK-52E
monolayers and MCF10A acini
As previously described ( Aoki et al., 2013 ), we also observed
similar ERK waves triggered by apoptosis in Madin-Darby
Canine Kidney (MDCK) and NRK-52E renal epithelial cell mono-
layers expressing the EKAREV-NLS ERK sensor ( Figure 2 A;
Video S2 ). Analysis of signaling trajectories ranked according
to the distance from the apoptotic cell showed that ERK activity
propagated radially/unidirectionally in both lines (Figure 2 B).
MDCK ERK waves were large, often mixed with neighboring
waves, and traveled outside the ﬁeld of view. NRK-52E ERK
waves involved mainly 1–2 layers, leading to activation of/C24 20
cells ( Figures 2 C and 2D). To exclude the possibility that
signaling waves were artifacts of the monolayer culture, we
evaluated ERK dynamics in 3D MCF10A acini cultures (Debnath
et al., 2003 ). We found that single apoptotic cells can trigger
radially propagating ERK waves in neighboring cells ( Figures
2E and 2F). These waves occur alongside other, more frequent
non-apoptotic ERK waves that occur spontaneously and con-
trol mammary acinar morphogenesis ( Ender et al., 2020 ). These
results show that at least ERK waves occur in different epithelial
cell types, species, and culture dimensionalities.
ERK/Akt waves are initiated during the early
morphological events of apoptosis
ERK/Akt waves were triggered by apoptosis that resulted from
starvation but also when apoptosis was induced by doxorubicin
or etoposide (Figures S2A–S2C). Apoptosis is associated with a
prototypical sequence of morphological events that include
nuclear shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin
condensation, cell extrusion, nuclear fragmentation, and disag-
gregation into apoptotic bodies (Saraste and Pulkki, 2000 ). In
epithelial cells, the two latter events are usually preceded by
extrusion that removes the apoptotic body before fragmentation
(Gagliardi et al., 2018 ; Rosenblatt et al., 2001 ). However, in
MCF10A cells extrusion was only successful in 40% of apoptotic
events, while in 60% of the events, formation of apoptotic bodies
was occurring within the monolayer. The onset of the ERK/Akt
waves coincided with nuclear shrinkage, the ﬁrst event of the
apoptosis sequence, which was then used as a reference to
temporally align the collective events (Figures 3 A and 3G). The
other morphological hallmarks of apoptosis, including epithelial
extrusion, occurred after the emergence of the signaling wave,
ruling them out as potential initiators of the wave (Figures
3B–3G).
To causally link apoptosis with signaling wave initiation, we
used OptoBAX, an optogenetic actuator that selectively induces
apoptosis with single-cell resolution (Godwin et al., 2019 ). Low
efﬁciency transfection was used to achieve stochastic expres-
sion of plasmids encoding Cry2-BAX and a mitochondrion-
anchored Cib fusion in the monolayer (Figure 3H). Upon exposure
to blue light, Cry2-BAX translocates to the mitochondrion and

induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) ( Figure 3 I), causing apoptosis in less than an hour. We
observed that OptoBAX-induced apoptosis triggered an ERK
wave identical to the one caused by starvation-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3J).
To further delineate the mechanisms that trigger the signaling
wave, we treated cells with zVAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor.
zVAD-FMK did not prevent ERK/Akt waves in starvation-induced
or OptoBAX-triggered apoptosis ( Figures 3K, 3L, and S2D–S2H).
Further, upon zVAD-FMK treatment, apoptotic cells triggering
signaling waves still displayed caspase-independent nuclear
shrinkage and chromatin condensation ( Figures S2 I and S2J)
but did not exhibit caspase-dependent extrusion or apoptotic
body formation (Figure S2 K). This shows that ERK/Akt waves
can be triggered by MOMP and correlate with the initial morpho-
logical events of apoptosis, independently of caspase activation.

ERK/Akt waves are triggered through EGFR and MMP
signaling
To explore the signaling networks responsible for the apoptosis-
triggered ERK/Akt waves, we treated starved monolayers with
different inhibitors. MEK inhibition abrogated ERK waves without
having any effect on Akt waves. Conversely, Akt inhibition abro-
gated Akt waves without any effect on ERK waves ( Figures 4 A
and S3A–S3C). This suggests a common upstream activator of
ERK/Akt. Paracrine EGFR signaling initiated by MMP-mediated
cleavage of pro-EGF ligands occurs in different epithelial

systems (Aoki et al., 2017 ; Young et al., 2015 ). Inhibition of EGFR
catalytic activity by geﬁtinib, ligand binding by cetuximab, or
MMPs by batimastat completely abrogated apoptosis-triggered
ERK/Akt waves ( Figures 4 A and S3D–S3F). OptoBax-triggered
apoptosis yielded identical results ( Figures 4 B and S3G). Treat-
ment with doramapimod and SP600125, inhibitors of
p38MAPK and JNK activity, respectively, showed that ERK/Akt
waves are independent from these two pathways (Figures 4 A,
S3I, and S3J). Treatment of cells with geﬁtinib, batimastat or
the IGF-1R inhibitor BMS754807 and simultaneous stimulation
with EGF or insulin-like GF (IGF-I), shows the speciﬁcity of
EGFR inhibition on ERK/Akt activity (Figure S4 A).
To understand whether ERK/Akt waves propagated due to
free diffusion of secreted EGFR ligands, we evaluated signaling
responses under ﬂow using a microﬂuidic device (Ryu et al.,
2015). Based on the typical diffusion coefﬁcient of small secreted
EGFR ligands (Nauman et al., 2007 ), we evaluated that a 25- mm/s
ﬂow was sufﬁcient to counteract EGFR ligand’s diffusion ( Fig-
ure S4B). Using ﬂuorescent beads, we calibrated the microﬂuidic
device to apply the desired ﬂow ( Figures S4 C–S4E; Video S3 ).
ERK/Akt waves and their signaling trajectories did not differ in
the presence or absence of ﬂow (Figures 4 C, S4F, and S4G).
Furthermore, the ﬂow did not affect the size or the symmetry of
waves ( Figures 4 D and 4E), ruling out free diffusion of any
EGFR ligand as a mechanism to shape waves.
Previous reports have identiﬁed ADAM metallopeptidase
domain 17 (ADAM17) as the MMP involved in generation of
ERK signaling waves induced by oncogenes in healthy neigh-
bors or during wound repair in vitro (Aikin et al., 2020 ; Aoki
et al., 2017 ). To explore its involvement in apoptotic ERK waves,
we used ADAM17 knockout cells (ADAM17 KO) ( Aikin et al.,
2020). ADAM17 KO did not abrogate apoptosis-triggered ERK
waves, but caused asynchronous, delayed, and smaller waves
(Figures S4 H–S4J). To understand whether apoptotic or neigh-
boring cells require ADAM17 to transmit the signal, we per-
formed co-culture experiments ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Wild-type
(WT) apoptotic cells within ADAM17 KO neighbors yielded
normal ERK waves. In contrast, ADAM17 KO apoptotic cells
within WT neighbors triggered aberrant ERK waves as described
above ( Figures 4 F–4H), without changing the wave size ( Fig-
ure S4 K). These local phenomena led to striking effects on the
population-level frequency of ERK pulses. A pure ADAM17 KO
cell population displayed a reduced ERK pulse frequency
when compared with a WT cell population ( Figure 4 I). When
co-cultured, ADAM17 KO cells showed an increased pulse
frequency. Conversely, WT cells showed a decreased pulse fre-
quency ( Figures S4 L and S4M). These results indicate MMP-
mediated cleavage of pro-EGF ligands, partially through
ADAM17, regulates ERK/Akt waves in an EGFR-dependent
fashion ( Figure 4 J).
ERK/Akt waves are not necessary for cell extrusion
Next, we explored the function of the apoptosis-triggered ERK/
Akt waves. We hypothesized that ERK/Akt waves might regulate
cytoskeletal processes during epithelial extrusion ( Gagliardi
et al., 2018 ; Rosenblatt et al., 2001 ). This is in line with the ERK
waves regulating myosin contractility during wound repair ( Aoki
et al., 2017 ). To test this hypothesis, we detected cumulated
apoptotic debris extruded in the supernatant ( Figure S5 A). We
used starvation to trigger apoptosis and epithelial extrusion. In-
hibition of extrusion caused by zVAD-FMK led to low amounts
of apoptotic debris in the supernatant ( Figures S5 B and S5C).
In contrast, inhibition of ERK/Akt waves using MEK, Akt,
EGFR, and MMPs inhibitors did not block this process ( Fig-
ure S5 D). Direct observation of individual extrusion events in
MCF10A cells ( Figure S5 E) and measurements of extrusion
time in MDCK cells yielded similar results ( Figure S5 F). We also
evaluated the assembly of the extrusion basal actomyosin ring
using cells co-expressing LifeAct-mCherry and ERK-KTR-mTur-
quoise2 (Figure S5 G). The closure of the basal actomyosin ring
occurred during the ﬁrst hour after nuclear shrinkage and
completely depended on caspase activity. Trametinib-, geﬁti-
nib-, cetuximab-, or batimastat-mediated ERK or AZD5362-
mediated Akt inhibition did not yield any noticeable effect on
ring closure ( Figure S5 G). Altogether, these results imply that
EGFR-dependent ERK/Akt waves are not necessary for cyto-
skeletal processes during epithelial extrusion.
Apoptosis-triggered ERK/Akt waves provide local
survival signals
We then explored whether signaling waves regulate fate deci-
sions. ERK pulses regulate EGF-dependent cell-cycle entry ( Al-
beck et al., 2013 ). However, starved MCF10A cells seldom pro-
liferate (Ethier and Moorthy, 1991 ). Given that ERK/Akt signaling
also regulates survival ( Franke et al., 2003 ; Lu and Xu, 2006 ), we
hypothesized that the signaling waves provide local survival sig-
nals. To test this, we evaluated how signaling dynamics regu-
lates survival and apoptosis fates at the single-cell level. We
restricted the analysis to ERK signaling, produced a high-quality
dataset of trajectories with 1 min resolution, and annotated
>1,000 apoptotic events. First, we compared ERK trajectories
in a 6 h window before apoptosis with those of non-apoptotic
cells during the same window. For that purpose, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify apoptotic and
non-apoptotic cells based on ERK activity ( Figures 5 A and 5B).

the classes showed clustering of apoptotic and non-apoptotic
ERK trajectories ( Figure 5 A). Prototype trajectories, for which
the model conﬁdence was the highest, showed that the ERK
pulse frequency is the most discriminative factor used by the
CNN to separate apoptotic from non-apoptotic fates (Figure 5B).
Based on this observation, we compared ERK pulse frequency
with the cell fate and with the CNN classiﬁcation output. /C24 65%
of cells that did not exhibit any ERK pulses were apoptotic. In
contrast, only/C24 30% of cells with 2–5 pulses and 0% with >5
pulses underwent apoptosis ( Figure 5 C). Evaluation of ERK tra-
jectories in MDCK and NRK-52E cells also revealed a reduced
pulse frequency in apoptotic cells compared with non-apoptotic
cells (Figure S6A). These results suggest that the apoptosis/sur-
vival fates in starved monolayers depend on the ERK pulse
frequency.
Second, we quantiﬁed differences in participation of apoptotic
and non-apoptotic cells in collective signaling events. We devel-
oped a computational approach that automatically identiﬁes col-
lective ERK waves (Figures 5 D and S6B). We found that 24%
(SD = 6) of ERK pulses were part of such events and that 67%
(SD = 8) of collective waves were triggered by apoptosis within
a 20 min time window. Then, we temporally aligned ERK trajec-
tories of apoptotic cells with respect to apoptotic events, over-
laid occurrences of collective events, and compared the
incidence of the latter with those of non-apoptotic cells (Fig-
ure 5 E). Collective ERK signaling events occurred in only
/C24 32% of apoptotic trajectories, compared with /C24 53% non-
apoptotic cells ( Figures 5E and 5F). Moreover, ERK pulsing dur-
ing a 3 h window before apoptosis was less frequent than in the
time before ( Figures 5 E and S6C). These results indicate that
cells that experience collective ERK events are less likely to die
than cells that do not.
Third, we explored whether an ERK pulse within an apoptosis-
triggered signaling wave locally promotes survival. Thus, we
evaluated the signaling history of ‘‘secondary’’ apoptotic cells
located within the 1st layer of neighbors of a primary apoptotic
event ( Figures 5 G–5I; Video S4 ). We found that up to 4 h after
the primary apoptosis, secondary apoptosis is signiﬁcantly
less likely to occur in cells that experienced an ERK pulse
induced by the primary event ( Figure 5 J). We obtained the
same result with the 2nd layer of neighbors ( Figure S6 D). Evalu-
ating the cumulative distribution of the probability of a secondary
apoptotic event revealed a lower apoptosis probability for neigh-
bors that received a pulse from the primary apoptotic event
compared with those that did not (Figure S6E). This strongly sug-
gests that apoptosis induces waves of ERK and Akt activity that
locally induce survival for approximately 4 h. We term this pro-
cess apoptosis-induced survival (AiS).
ERK pulse frequency determines survival fate
To establish whether speciﬁc signaling dynamics regulates the
survival fate, we used 2 optogenetic systems to evoke different
signaling pulse frequencies. We simultaneously measured ERK
activity using spectrally compatible ERK-KTR-mRuby2 (Fig-
ure 6 A). The ﬁrst system is a photo-excitable ﬁbroblast growth
factor (FGF)-1-based receptor (OptoFGFR) that activates both
ERK and Akt signaling (Kim et al., 2014 ) and thus mimics the
EGFR-dependent signaling observed in our cell system. The
second is a photo-excitable RAF construct (OptoRAF) that
selectively controls ERK activity ( Aoki et al., 2017 ). For both sys-
tems, a 100 ms of 3 W/cm 2 pulse of blue light could induce a
robust ERK pulse of similar amplitude ( Figures 6B and 6C; Video
S5). We induced ERK pulses with light stimulation applied every
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h with both optogenetic systems during a 24-
h period after starvation ( Figures 6D, 6E, and 6G). We measured
a robust reduction of the apoptotic rate when ERK pulses were
triggered at least every 3 h with OptoFGFR (Figure 6 F; Video
S6). At the cell population level, this almost completely sup-
pressed the peak of apoptosis triggered by starvation ( Fig-
ure S6F). ERK or Akt inhibition abrogated the protection granted
by the stimulation of OptoFGFR at high frequency ( Figure S6 G).
We observed similar effects with OptoRAF in which high stimu-
lation frequencies (1, 2, 3, and 4 h pulse periodicity) provided
robust protection, which then gradually diminished at lower
frequencies ( Figure 6 H). Contrary to OptoFGFR, the effect of
OptoRAF pulses on survival was independent from Akt activity
(Figure S6 H) and completely dependent on the MAPK pathway
(Figures S6I and S6J). Using batimastat, which unspeciﬁcally in-
creases the apoptosis rate regardless of light pulses, we also
excluded a possible ERK-ADAM17-EGFR axis through which
OptoRAF could exert its pro-survival effect (Figure S6 K). Using
both optogenetic systems, ERK pulses induced every 3–4 h
were sufﬁcient for survival. OptoFGFR mediated its effect
through both ERK and Akt, while OptoRAF only through ERK.
However, the expression of the OptoRAF system increases
basal survival (compare Figures 5 F and 5H), introducing a small
bias in our system.
AiS maintains epithelial integrity in response to
environmental insults of different intensities
AiS might contribute to population-level EH and epithelial integ-
rity in response to environmental insults. To explore that, we
evaluated the rate of apoptosis in response to starvation and
compared it with population-averaged ERK/Akt activity ( Fig-
ure 7 A). Monolayer starvation resulted in a transient peak of
apoptosis that started 2–3 h after starvation and lasted for
another 4–5 h until a steady state, low apoptosis rate ensued.
Strikingly, population-averaged ERK/Akt activities immediately
decreased with starvation and transiently reactivated with ki-
netics that were slightly delayed with respect to the apoptotic
rate. This suggests that the whole monolayer can adapt to star-
vation-induced stress by dynamically regulating survival to main-
tain EH and epithelial integrity.
We built a mathematical model to capture the dynamic rela-
tionship between apoptosis and survival. The model consists
of 2 interacting components: apoptotic cells, and the protection
from cell death mediated by ERK/Akt activity ( Figure 7B). The in-
crease in protection level depends on the rate of apoptosis,
which in turn is negatively regulated by the amount of protection
in the system. We varied the rate constants of apoptosis and pro-
tection activation and calculated the fold change in the half-life of
the initial cell pool with respect to the half-life of a pure exponen-
tial decay, i.e., a model without the protection component
(Figure 7 C). We investigated 3 scenarios ( Figures 7 C and 7D).
In scenario 1, we set a low rate of apoptosis and a high rate of
protection activation to mimic our starvation experiment (Fig-
ure 7 D). The model agreed with the starvation experiment ( Fig-
ure 7 A) in that an episode of increased apoptosis is followed
ll
Article

by a delayed induction of protection. In scenario 2, we increased
the rate of apoptosis (e.g., as possibly induced by a cytotoxic
drug), which yielded higher apoptosis and protection levels after
the initial transient ( Figure 7 D, upper panel). Although the cell
number decreases faster in scenario 2 than in scenario 1, the
high protection level prevents cells from dying with the rate of
a pure exponential decay ( Figure 7 D, lower panel). In scenario
3, we maintained the high apoptosis rate, but we lowered the
protection rate (e.g., by inhibiting ERK/Akt activity). Here, the
apoptosis rate exhibits a much slower transient due to a weaker
protection (Figure 7 D upper panel), leading the cell count to
closely follow a pure exponential decay ( Figure 7D, lower panel).
To experimentally validate the results obtained from the model
(scenarios 2/3), we treated our cells with doxorubicin, which in-
duces apoptosis by oxidative stress in MCF10A cells (Gajewski
et al., 2007 ). A dose response screen identiﬁed 2.5 and 5 mM
doxorubicin as concentrations that induce potent cell death ( Fig-
ure S7A). This induced a steep apoptosis increase from 5 to 7 h
after incubation, followed by steady apoptosis levels that corre-
sponded to approximately 3%–4% of the cell population per
hour for more than 10 h ( Figure S7 B). The steep apoptosis
increase was followed by a slightly delayed increase of ERK/
Akt population average activity that then remained high ( Figures
7E, S7C, and S7D). Lower doxorubicin doses that promoted low
apoptosis only led to low ERK/Akt activity ( Figures S7 C and
S7D). These results are in line with the predictions of scenario
2 of our model ( Figure 7 D). To exclude that ERK/Akt activation
was due to accumulation of EGFR ligands in the supernatant,
we kept the cells under constant perfusion ( Figure S4 C). With
doxorubicin, we observed an increase in the apoptotic rate
reaching about 4% at 13 h post addition (Figure S7 E). This
also resulted in higher ERK/Akt activities compared with the un-
treated control ( Figures S7 F–S7H). This excludes accumulation
of ligands as the cause of the global increase in ERK/Akt activity.
To explore if this sustained population-level ERK/Akt activity
was due to AiS, we inhibited EGFR, MMPs, ERK, or Akt and eval-
uated apoptosis rates. While individual inhibitors had only
modest effect on apoptosis, their combination with doxorubicin
caused a dramatic increase in the apoptotic rate ( Figures 7F, S7I,
and S7J), as predicted in scenario 3 of our model ( Figure 6D). To

characterize how changes in apoptosis rate impact epithelial
integrity, we measured hole formation in the monolayer. We
found that doxorubicin-drug combinations quickly led to loss
of epithelial integrity /C24 15 h after drug treatment, while doxoru-
bicin alone only led to few holes ( Figures 7 G and 7H; Video
S7). Further, we observed an inverse correlation between popu-
lation-averaged ERK/Akt activity levels and the holed area 20 h
after doxorubicin treatment (Figure 6 I). These results strongly
suggest that AiS contributes to epithelial integrity by reacting
to environmental insults of different intensities ( Figure 6 J).
DISCUSSION
Epithelial tissues require dynamic coordination of apoptosis,
survival, and proliferation to maintain a critical cell density and
barrier function ( Macara et al., 2014 ). We report on AiS, a
signaling mechanism that preserves EH in response to environ-
mental stresses (Figure 6J). At the single-cell scale, AiS involves
apoptosis-triggered ERK/Akt waves that protect nearby cells
from apoptosis for 3–4 h. At the population scale, AiS allows
the cell collective to adjust survival fate levels to react to environ-
mental insults of different intensities. This mechanism is
conserved across different epithelial cell lines and might also
contribute to mammary acinar morphogenesis.
Mechanism of ERK/Akt wave propagation
We ﬁnd that the ERK/Akt wave propagation depends on canon-
ical EGFR signaling (Figure 4 J). This does not involve free diffu-
sion of an EGFR ligand from apoptotic cells ( Figures 4 C–4E)
but rather MMP-mediated cleavage of membrane-bound pre-
cursor EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin (Dong et al., 1999 ).
This might generate a trigger wave, in which each cell layer
sequentially activates the next one through EGFR/MMP
signaling. We show that ADAM17 might be required for shedding
of the EGFR ligand from the apoptotic cell (Figure 4J). However,
ADAM17 loss does not completely abrogate ERK/Akt waves,
suggesting the involvement of additional players. Similar
EGFR/MMP-dependent ERK waves control myosin contractility
to organize collective epithelial cell migration in MDCK cells ( Aoki
et al., 2017 ; Hino et al., 2020 ). This suggests that EGFR/MMP-
dependent ERK/Akt waves are an evolutionarily conserved
pathway that can spatially regulate collective cell migration
and AiS-dependent EH.
Another factor that shapes the signaling wave is the non-line-
arity of the MAPK cascade ( Birtwistle and Kolch, 2011 ). The Raf/
MEK/ERK cascade exhibits ultrasensitivity and adaptation ( Ryu
et al., 2015 ; Santos et al., 2007 ; Sparta et al., 2015 ), producing
short ERK pulses of full amplitude even at low EGFR input. The
ﬁnding that the number of ERK pulsing cells decreases in the
successive layers of the wave ( Figure 1 I) suggests that the
EGFR/MAPK cascade operates at the threshold input required
for production of all-or-nothing ERK responses. This is consis-
tent with the minute amounts of EGFR ligand that might be
released by MMPs. Thus, the observed 3-layer reach of the
signaling wave might partly stem from the architecture of the
MAPK network. A similar network logic might produce Akt
pulses.
Fate decision regulation by ERK/Akt pulse frequency
EGF-stimulated and apoptosis-triggered ERK/Akt pulses are
virtually indistinguishable when compared outside of their spatial
context ( Figures 1 A and S1D). We show that low versus higher
ERK pulse frequencies correlate with apoptosis and survival
respectively ( Figures 5 A–5C). EGF stimulation can further in-
crease pulse frequency, leading to cell-cycle entry ( Albeck
et al., 2013 ). This suggests that low, medium, and high ERK/
Akt pulse frequencies, respectively, correlate with apoptosis,
survival, and proliferation fates. In native tissues, combinatorial
control of ERK/Akt pulses triggered by apoptosis or other sour-
ces might ﬁne-tune EH by contributing to both survival/prolifera-
tion fates.
How does a cell interpret the ERK/Akt signaling frequency into
these speciﬁc fates? Several known ERK or Akt substrates have
been implicated in regulating survival, such as the Akt substrate
BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD) ( Datta et al., 1997 )
or the ERK substrate Bcl-2-like protein 11 (BIM) ( Harada et al.,
2004). Another fate decision mechanism might involve ERK/
Akt-dependent control of transcriptional programs ( Avraham
and Yarden, 2011 ). In the case of ERK, this involves immediate
early genes (IEGs) that produce unstable transcripts with life-
times of 30–40 min, that in turn regulate the transcription of de-
layed early genes (DEGs) with a lifetime of 1–3 h. Thus, one digital
ERK/Akt pulse might switch on gene expression that ﬂuctuates
on the AiS timescale, allowing the cell collective to reset its sur-
vival fate and to remain responsive to future stimuli. High
signaling frequencies might then allow to control the proliferation
fate by regulation of IEGs such as Fra-1 that can linearly integrate
ERK activity over time ( Gillies et al., 2017 ). Another function of
Akt pulses might be the single-cell regulation of metabolic activ-
ities required for enforcing speciﬁc fate decisions ( Hung et al.,
2017). Finally, we speculate that the ERK pulses might regulate
myosin contractility on the timescale of minutes ( Aoki et al.,
2017; Hino et al., 2020 ) and fate decisions such as survival on
the timescale of hours. Thus, the MAPK pathway might function
in an integrative fashion by regulating processes at different
timescales to coordinate cytoskeletal and survival/proliferation
responses during morphogenetic processes.
Population-level AiS responses
Our experiments and computational simulations show that upon
the induction of apoptosis, e.g., through starvation or cytotoxic
drugs, the feedback embedded in AiS allows the epithelium to

dynamically adapt to different apoptotic rates. This might help to
mitigate acute spikes of apoptotic rates that potentially compro-
mise epithelial integrity, and to reach a new steady-state rate of
apoptosis compatible with the regenerative capability of the
epithelial tissue. Our mechanistic explanation of AiS is consistent
with numerous reports in which targeting EGFR-ERK/Akt sensi-
tizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents ( Barbuti et al.,
2019; Holt et al., 2012 ; Smolensky et al., 2017 ). This provides a
rationale to test further targeted/cytotoxic combination therapies
to obtain better therapeutic responses in cancer.
Physiological relevance of AiS signaling
Further studies are needed to understand the role of AiS in vivo.
ERK activity waves have been observed in vivo in mouse
epithelia ( Hiratsuka et al., 2015 ). Here, the ERK activity waves
correlate with G2/M cell-cycle progression, but it is conceivable
that additional inputs, not present in our starved monolayer, con-
trol this speciﬁc fate decision. Valon and colleagues ( Valon et al.,
2021) reported apoptosis-triggered, EGFR-dependent ERK
pulses during development of the Drosophila pupal notum.
This might provide robustness against external perturbations
during development. These similarities suggest that AiS is a
highly conserved mechanism regulating epithelial integrity
throughout the animal kingdom.
Limitations of the study
Here, we have focused on how apoptosis-induced ERK/Akt
waves regulate survival. However, we cannot formally exclude
that other signaling pathways also feed into the regulation of
survival.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines
Wild-type human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A cells were a gift of J.S. Brugge, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. ADAM17
KO MCF10A cells expressing H2B-iRFP (no selection), ERK1-mRuby2 (Blast), ERK-KTR-mCerulean3 (Hygro) and their WT counter-
part were a gift of T. Aikin and S. Regot, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD (Aikin et al., 2020 ). MCF10A cells were
cultured in growth medium composed by DMEM:F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml recombinant human EGF
(Peprotech), 10 mg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), 200 U/ml penicillin and
200 mg/ml streptomycin. All the experiments were carried out in starvation medium composed by DMEM:F12 supplemented with
0.3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), 200 U/ml penicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin.
Growth factor and serum starvation experiments were executed by removing the growth medium, 2 washes in PBS and replacement
with starvation medium. MDCK and NRK-52E expressing EKAREV-NLS were a gift from K. Aoki (Aoki et al., 2013 , 2017). MDCK and
NRK-52E cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 200 U/ml penicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin.
METHOD DETAILS

AZD5363 (Selleck Chemicals), Batimastat (MedChem Express), BMS-754807 (MedChem Express), Doramapimod (MedChem Ex-
press), Doxorubicin (MedChem Express), Etoposide (MedChem Express), Geﬁtinib (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck), SCH772984 (MedChem
Express), SP600125 (MedChem Express), Trametinib (Selleck Chemicals) and zVAD-FMK (UBPBio) were dissolved in DMSO and
preserved at -20 /C14 C in small aliquots to avoid thaw-freeze cycles. Cetuximab was purchased from MedChem Express. EGF (Pepro-
tech) and IGF-I (Peprotech) were dissolved in aqueous solution and preserved at -20 /C14 C.
Plasmids
The stable nuclear marker H2B-miRFP703 was a gift from Vladislav Verkhusha (Addgene plasmid # 80001) ( Shcherbakova et al.,
2016), and subcloned in the PiggyBac plasmid pPBbSr2-MCS. ERK-KTR-mTurquoiose2 and ERK-KTR-mRuby2 sequences were
synthesized (GENWIZ) by fusing the ERK Kinase Translocation Reporter (ERK-KTR) CDS ( Regot et al., 2014 ) with mTurquoiose2
(Goedhart et al., 2012 ) and mRuby2 ( Lam et al., 2012 ) CDSs, respectively. FoxO3a-mNeonGreen sequence was synthesized (GEN-
WIZ) by fusing the 1-1188 portion of the homo sapiens forkhead box O3 a (FoxO3a) CDS with mNeonGreen CDS, a green ﬂuorescent
protein derived by Branchiostoma lanceolatum ( Shaner et al., 2013 ). ERK-KTR-mTurquoiose2, ERK-KTR-mRuby2, FoxO3a-mNeon-
green and LifeAct-mCherry were cloned in the PiggyBac plasmids pMP-PB, pSB-HPB (gift of David Hacker, Lausanne,

(Balasubramanian et al., 2016 )) or pPB3.0.Blast, an improved PiggyBac plasmid generated in our lab. For stable DNA integration we
transfected the PiggyBac plasmids together with the helper plasmid expressing the transposase ( Yusa et al., 2011 ). Transfection of
MCF10A cells was carried out with FuGene (Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. Stable clones with the different bio-
sensors/optogenetic tools were generated by antibiotic selection and image-based screening.
The MOMP optogenetic actuator Cry2(1–531).L348F.mCh.BAX.S184E and Tom20.CIB.GFP, originally designated as the
OptoBAX 2.0 system, and here termed as OptoBAX, was generated by Robert M Hughes ( Godwin et al., 2019 ). Lyn-cytoFGFR1-
PHR-mCit, expressing myristoylated FGFR1 cytoplasmic region fused with PHR domain of cryptochrome2 and mCitrine, here
deﬁned as OptoFGFR, was a gift from Won Do Heo (Addgene plasmid # 59776) (Kim et al., 2014 ). Lyn-cytoFGFR1-PHR-mCit
was subcloned in a lentiviral backbone for stable cell line generation. pPB3.0-PuroCRY2-cRAF-mCitrine-P2A-CIBN-KrasCT, here
deﬁned as OptoRAF, was generated as an improvement of the previously reported light-induced ERK activation system, gift from
Kazuhiro Aoki ( Aoki et al., 2017 ). Cloning was done in two steps. First, the CRY2-cRaf sequence was cut from the pCX4puro-
CRY2-cRAF plasmid using EcoRI and NotI. mCitrine was PCR ampliﬁed from the OptoFGFR plasmid adding NotI and XhoI sites
and digested. Both sequences were ligated in the pPB3.0-Puro opened with EcoRI and XhoI. The GSGP2A-CIBN-KRasCT sequence
(synthesized by GENWIZ) was digested with BsrGI and AﬂII and ligated in the opened pPB3.0-Puro-CRY2-cRAF-mCitrine.
Live imaging
MCF10A cells were seeded on 5 mg/ml Fibronectin (PanReac AppliChem) on 24 well 1.5 glass bottom plates (Cellvis) at 1x10 5 cells/
well density two days before the experiment. Imaging experiments were performed on an epiﬂuorescence Eclipse Ti inverted ﬂuo-
rescence microscope (Nikon) controlled by NIS-Elements (Nikon) with a Plan Apo air 203 (NA 0.8) or a Plan Apo air 40 3 (NA 0.9)
objectives. Laser-based autofocus was used throughout the experiments. Image acquisition was performed with an Andor Zyla
4.2 plus camera at a 16-bit depth. The following excitation and emission ﬁlters (Chroma) were used: far red: 640nm, ET705/72m;
red: 555nm, ET652/60m; NeonGreen: 508nm, ET605/52; GFP: 470nm, ET525/36m; mTurquoise2: 440nm, HQ480/40.
MCF10A acini
3D live imaging experiments with MCF10A acini and the accompanying image analysis were performed as described in ( Ender et al.,
2020). Single MCF10A cells were embedded in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning) and kept in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
2% horse serum, 20 ng/ml recombinant human EGF, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 mg/ml insulin, 200 U/ml penicillin and 200 mg/ml
streptomycin, which induced the development of acini. After 3 days in culture, EGF, insulin and horse serum were removed from the
medium. 25 mM Hepes was to the medium added before imaging.
Images were acquired on an epiﬂuorescence Eclipse Ti2 inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-W1 spin-
ning disk confocal system (Yokogawa) and a Plan Apo VC 60X water immersion objective (NA = 1.2). Image acquisition was done at
16 bit depth with a Prime 95B camera (Teledyne Photometrics). A temperature control system and gas mixer (both Life Imaging Ser-
vices) were used throughout imaging, as well as laser-based autofocus.
3D segmentation of nuclei and extraction of cytosolic/nuclear ERK KTR ﬂuorescence intensity levels were performed using an up-
dated version of the open source LEVER software ( Winter et al., 2016 ). The apoptotic event was manually identiﬁed and annotated.
Optogenetic experiments
Cells expressing OptoBAX, OptoFGFR or OptoRAF were kept in the dark for at least 24h before the experiments and all preparatory mi-
croscope setup was carried out with red or green light (wavelength > 550 nm). In the case of OptoBAX, cells expressing H2B-miRFP703
and ERK-KTR-mTurquoise2 were transfected with OptoBAX plasmids the day before the experiment to obtain sparse transfected cells
(< 1% of the total cell population) in the MCF10A epithelium. Cells expressing the OptoBAX system were identiﬁed through the expression
of Cry2(1–531).L348F.mCh.BAX.S184E fusion protein that contains mCherry. Fields of view containing conﬂuent monolayers and at max
1-2 OptoBAX cells were selected for the experiment. Cells were illuminated with whole ﬁeld blue light at 440nm every two minutes for the
entire duration of the experiment to both induce translocation of BAX to mitochondria and to image ERK-KTR-mTurquoise2. Additionally
cells were illuminated at 508nm to visualize Tom20.CIB.GFP, 555nm for mCherry (BAX fusion protein) and 640nm H2B-miRFP703. In the
cases of OptoFGFR or OptoRAF, cells expressing H2B-miRFP703 and ERK-KTR-mRuby2 were infected with the lentiviral vector ex-
pressing Lyn-cytoFGFR1-PHR-mCit or transfected with pPB3.0.PURO.CRY2.cRAF.mCitrine.P2A.CIBN.KrasCT plasmid to generate
stably expressing clones. Cells were imaged at 555nm for mRuby2 and 640nm H2B-miRFP703, and stimulated with 488 nm blue light
for 100 ms at 3 W/cm 2, when required by the experiment protocol. Stimulation experiments were controlled by NIS jobs.
Image analysis
For nuclear segmentation, we used a random forest classiﬁer based on different pixel features available in Ilastik software ( Berg
et al., 2019 ). For the training phase, we manually annotated nuclear (in 20-50 cells) and background pixels in 16-bit time-lapse TIF
images of the nuclear channel (H2B-miRFP703). The probability map of nuclei was then exported as 32-bit TIF images to perform
threshold-based segmentation using CellProﬁler 3.0 (McQuin et al., 2018 ). Expansion of nuclear objects by a predeﬁned number of
pixels was used to identify the area corresponding to the cytoplasm on a cell-by-cell basis, as described previously ( Pargett et al.,
2017). Cytosol/nuclear ratio was calculated by dividing the average cytosolic pixel intensity by the average nuclear pixel intensity.
For visualization and quality control, we created images of segmented nuclei color coded according to ERK-KTR C/N. Single-cell
tracking was performed on nuclear centroids in MATLAB using m-track 2.2.1 ( Jaqaman et al., 2008 ). For FRET experiments with
ll

MDCK and NRK-52E expressing EKAREV-NLS we used a partially modiﬁed pipeline. We used the donor channel for pixel clas-
siﬁcation of nuclei in Ilastik. We then used CellProﬁler 3.0 to correct uneven illumination, to segment nuclei from the Ilastik nuclear
prediction, and to calculate the FRET ratio, where the FRET image is divided pixel-by-pixel by the Donor image. Single-cell
tracking was performed on nuclear centroids in MATLAB using m-track 2.2.1.
Apoptotic events were annotated manually based on nuclear shrinkage to set time to 0. This approach showed higher accuracy
compared to any available computational or marker-based methods.
Holes in the epithelial layer were identiﬁed using Ilastik’s machine learning algorithm starting from the manual annotation of holes in
a combined ERK-KTR-mTurquoiose2 FoxO3a-mNeonGreen channel. After segmentation of the hole probability, their total area in
each frame and ﬁeld of view was calculated with Fiji.
Extrusion assay
MCF10A cells were seeded in 6 well plates (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG) at 4x10 5 cells and grown for 3-4 days till reaching the
homeostatic conﬂuent state. The evening before, the wells were washed twice with DMEM:F12, 0.3% BSA, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocorti-
sone, 200 U/ml penicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin. After 16h, suspended material, including cell debris, was collected, concen-
trated and stained for 10 min with Hoechst and CellMask orange (Thermo Fisher). The stained debris were put in between two
coverslips and acquired with a wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscope with a 20 3 objective. Particles were segmented with CellProﬁler
3.0 and data analyzed with R.
Microﬂuidic device fabrication and preparation
Microﬂuidic devices were prepared as described previously ( Ryu et al., 2015 ). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer (Dow Corning)
was mixed with the catalyzer in 10:1 ratio in a plastic beaker. A ﬁrst layer of 4–5 g was poured on the master and then degassed in a
desiccator before solidifying at 80/C14 C for 1 h. Eight-well reservoir strips (Evergreen) were divided in 2 and then glued on the ﬁrst layer
using PDMS and solidifying at 80 /C14 C for 30 min. Finally, the second layer of 15–20 g of PDMS is used to ﬁnalize the device. The PDMS
replica was cut and punched at the appropriate inlets and outlets. Plasma treatment was used to bond the PDMS replica to the 50 3
70 mm coverslip (Matsunami, Japan) to allow for proper sealing that resists the high-pressure applied during the experiments. To
enhance the bonding strength, the device was heated for 15 min in an 80 /C14 C dry oven. After bonding, the device was immediately
ﬁlled by adding 200 mlo f1 0 mg/ml ﬁbronectin solution in PBS to each outlet reservoir and put at 37 /C14 C. To increase coating efﬁciency
in the device, 10 ml of the ﬁbronectin solution was aspirated 3 3 from the cell seeding port after 1 h each before seeding cells.
MCF10A cell suspensions were prepared at a concentration of 1 x 10 7 cells/ml. 30 ml of this cell suspension was added to the outlet
reservoir and aspirated with a pipette from the cell reservoir inlet port. 250 ml complete medium was added to each outlet reservoir
and 150 ml of starving medium to each inlet reservoir. Devices were kept overnight in the incubator. Before experiments, the medium
in the inlet and outlet reservoir was removed and 240 ml of appropriate medium was added to the inlet reservoir. Before imaging, de-
vices were connected to an Elevsys OB-1 ﬂow controller and the desired air pressure (0 or 500 mPsi was applied).
Data analysis
To analyze and visualize single-cell ERK/Akt activity time series, we used Time Course Inspector ( Dobrzy/C19nski et al., 2020 ) and we
wrote a set of custom R/Python codes. All R notebooks with code required to reproduce the plots and the underlying data are avail-
able as supplementary information (link to online repository:https://doi.org/10.17632/kd3n5k784m).
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained as a binary classiﬁer that discriminates between apoptotic and non-apoptotic
cells based on their ERK activity time series. These come from four experiments where ERK activity in MCF10A cells was measured
every minute. We manually annotated apoptotic cells by visual inspection of the movies and obtained 448 time series with a duration
of 8h before the nuclear contraction. To create a balanced dataset and to avoid classiﬁcation bias towards either of the classes, we
selected 448 random time series of equal duration with cells that did not undergo apoptosis. We performed a data augmentation step
by taking random 6h-long segments at every training epoch of the CNN analysis.
We chose a plain CNN architecture as described previously ( Zhou et al., 2016 ). It consists of several convolution layers followed by
global average pooling (GAP) and a fully connected layer right before the output layer. The advantages of this architecture are a low
number of parameters and a strong overﬁt counterweight with the GAP layer. The architecture comprises 6 successive 1D convolu-
tional layers, all composed of 20 ﬁlters except for the last layer with 7 ﬁlters. In these layers, the convolution kernel sizes are (5, 5, 5, 5,
3, 3), respectively, with a stride of 1 and a padding that ensures a constant size of the input representation throughout the network.
Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
The whole dataset (training and validation sets) was passed once through the network and the representation of time series after
the GAP layer was projected in 2D with tSNE ( Figure 5 A). Time series that maximized the model conﬁdence for a given class were
reported as prototypes. Time series for which entropy of the classiﬁcation output was maximal ( i.e. the model returns nearly 50%
conﬁdence for both classes) were reported as low-conﬁdence prototypes.

Peak detection
The number of ERK activity peaks was calculated with an algorithm that detects local maxima in time series. A local maxima is deﬁned
as a point that exceeds the value of its neighbors by a threshold that we manually set for each dataset. The thresholds were: 1.5e-1 for
MCF10A cells; 5.0e-2 for the MCF10A/ADAM17KO co-culture experiments; 5.0e-3 for MDCK cells; 5.0e-3 for NRK cells.
Identiﬁcation of collective events
To estimate spatial correlations in ERK activity, for every ﬁeld of view and a time-lapse frame we calculated the local indicators
of spatial association ( Anselin, 1995 ) using the lisa function from the ncf package available for R. The function assumes the
value of ERK-KTR C/N ﬂuorescence intensity and X/Y positions of the nucleus’ centroid. It then outputs the Moran’s I autocor-
relation coefﬁcient for cells within a radius, which we set to 100px, and the permutation two-sided p-value for each observation
based on 1000 resamples. After thresholding cells for the correlation > 0.5 and the p-value < 0.05 we applied the dbscan algo-
rithm from the R packagedbscan to identify clusters of collective ERK activity. We assumed that a collective event consisted of
a minimum 3 cells with the maximum distance between cells of 100px. This procedure yielded individual collective events in
each frame of the time lapse movie. We chose only those collective events where ERK-KTR C/N was above a threshold. To es-
timate the threshold, we performed k-means clustering with 2 centers on individual ERK-KTR C/N values from all collective
events. The threshold was the midpoint between the two cluster centers. Movies of nuclei color-coded according to ERK-
KTR C/N with collective events indicated with convex polygons were prepared with ffmpeg software from individual png ﬁles
produced by ggplot2 in R scripts.
Analysis of cells’ history
We matched the X/Y/T coordinates of manually annotated apoptotic events to single-cell time series using the distance_join
function from the fuzzyjoin package for R. Using the maximum euclidean distance of 10px we automatically matched /C24 95%
of apoptotic events. For further analysis, we chose only time series longer than 6h. To plot the ordered heatmaps in Figure 4 E, we
overlaid the instances of collective events onto C/N ERK-KTR time series of single cells that underwent apoptosis. As a negative con-
trol, for each apoptotic event, we chose a random cell from the same time frame that did not undergo apoptosis during the entire
experiment. We only compared sections of time series that matched the lifetime of apoptotic cells. To calculate the average percent-
age of non-apoptotic cells affected by collective events during a time window before apoptosis of the corresponding apoptotic cell
(Figure 5 F), we repeated the selection of random non-apoptotic cells 1000 times.
Mathematical model
The set of ODE equations was solved numerically using the function ode from the deSolve package in R:
C
0
ðtÞ = /C0 kapo
P4ðtÞ + 1 CðtÞ; Cð0Þ = 1
P1ðtÞ = kað/C0 C
0
ðtÞÞ/C0 kdP1ðtÞ; P1ð0Þ = 0
P2ðtÞ = kaP1ðtÞ/C0 kdP2ðtÞ; P2ð0Þ = 0
P3ðtÞ = kaP2ðtÞ/C0 kdP3ðtÞ; P3ð0Þ = 0
P4ðtÞ = kaP3ðtÞ/C0 kdP4ðtÞ; P4ð0Þ = 10
Where: C(t) - the total number of cells, P1-4(t) - protection steps, kapo - the rate of apoptosis, ka - the rate of protection activation,
kd - the rate of protection deactivation. For all simulations kd was set to 1. Other parameters for scenarios in Figures 4B and 4C: (1)
kapo = 0.01, ka = 5, (2) kapo = 0.05, ka = 5, (3) kapo = 0.05, ka = 2. The ratio P3(t)/C(t) was used as a measure of the average protection
level per cell.
