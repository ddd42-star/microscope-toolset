SUMMARY
Migrating ﬁbroblasts undergo contact inhibition of
locomotion (CIL), a process that was discovered
ﬁve decades ago and still is not fully understood at
the molecular level. We identify the Slit2-Robo4-
srGAP2 signaling network as a key regulator of CIL
in ﬁbroblasts. CIL involves highly dynamic contact
protrusions with a specialized actin cytoskeleton
that stochastically explore cell-cell overlaps between
colliding ﬁbroblasts. A membrane curvature-sensing
F-BAR domain pre-localizes srGAP2 to protruding
edges and terminates their extension phase in
response to cell collision. A FRET-based biosensor
reveals that Rac1 activity is focused in a band at
the tip of contact protrusions, in contrast to the broad
activation gradient in contact-free protrusions.
SrGAP2 speciﬁcally controls the duration of Rac1
activity in contact protrusions, but not in contact-
free protrusions. We propose that srGAP2 inte-
grates cell edge curvature and Slit-Robo-mediated
repulsive cues to ﬁne-tune Rac1 activation dynamics
in contact protrusions to spatiotemporally coordi-
nate CIL.
INTRODUCTION
Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) was ﬁrst described more
than 50 years ago by Abercrombie as a general cell repulsion
phenomenon between two contacting ﬁbroblasts (Abercrombie
and Heaysman, 1953, 1954). Nowadays, CIL is considered a
generic mechanism to locally cease cell protrusions in vitro
and in vivo (Mayor and Carmona-Fontaine, 2010). CIL consists
of two phases: initial cell-cell contact and collapse of
protrusions followed by cell repolarization and change of
migrational direction (Mayor and Carmona-Fontaine, 2010 ).
Cadherins (Scarpa et al., 2015; Theveneau et al., 2010; Hutten-
locher et al., 1998), nectins (Takai et al., 2008), heparan sulfate
proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Matthews et al., 2008), Ephrins (Astin
et al., 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2013), and non-canonical Wnt
signaling (Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008) have been shown to
regulate CIL. In many cases, this feeds into the control of cyto-
skeletal dynamics through Rho GTPases (Carmona-Fontaine
et al., 2008; Matthews et al., 2008; Theveneau et al., 2010;
Scarpa et al., 2015). However, the precise molecular link be-
tween such cell surface molecules and small GTPases remains
elusive.
Rho GTPases are key regulators of the cytoskeletal dynamics
that control cell migration (Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004;
Heasman and Ridley, 2008; Machacek et al., 2009; Pertz
et al., 2006; Ridley, 2006). Their activity is tightly controlled in
time and space by guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that respectively
activate and inhibit GTPases. Regulation of Rho GTPases by
different GEFs and GAPs, as well as coupling to speciﬁc down-
stream effectors, dictates the overall outcome of Rho GTPase
signaling at any given subcellular localization (Pertz, 2010).
Recent studies, in which spatiotemporal Rho GTPase activation
dynamics have been measured using ﬂuorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors, have revealed com-
plex spatiotemporal signaling programs in which the activity of
multiple Rho GTPases ﬂuctuates on time and length scales of
tens of seconds and single micrometers (Kraynov et al., 2000;
Machacek et al., 2009; Nalbant et al., 2004; Pertz et al., 2006).
An important question is, therefore, how global properties
such as cell migration speed and persistence emerge from
such exquisite spatiotemporal control of Rho GTPases at
smaller lengths and timescales.
Slit-Robo GAP (srGAP) proteins transduce repulsive cues
downstream of the Slit-Robo axon guidance pathway to inhibit
Rho GTPases (Wong et al., 2001; Ypsilanti et al., 2010). SrGAP2
regulates cell migration and neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells
as well as brain development (Charrier et al., 2012; Dennis
et al., 2012; Guerrier et al., 2009; Pertz et al., 2008).
Here we report that the Slit-Robo pathway controls ﬁbroblast
CIL. We ﬁnd that srGAP2 speciﬁcally regulates the dynamics of
specialized contact protrusions that stochastically explore cell-
cell overlaps at minute timescales. SrGAP2 regulates a speciﬁc
spatiotemporal pool of Rac1 activity within contact protrusions,
78 Developmental Cell35, 78–92, October 12, 2015ª2015 Elsevier Inc.
but is dispensable for contact-free protrusions. At the whole-cell
scale, this stochastic process ﬁne-tunes protrusion collapse and
cell repolarization to mediate CIL.
RESULTS
SrGAP2 Regulates Contact-Dependent Cell Migration
Using proteomics, we discovered srGAP2 to be expressed in
NIH 3T3 mouse ﬁbroblasts (Fengos et al., 2014). Given the
importance of srGAP2 in neuronal cell migration ( Guerrier
et al., 2009) and growth cone dynamics (Pertz et al., 2008), we
hypothesized that srGAP2 also regulates ﬁbroblast motility. We
therefore downregulatedSrgap2 by RNAi and tracked subcon-
ﬂuent randomly migrating cells (Figures 1A and 1B). Surprisingly,
Srgap2 knockdown (KD) neither affected total travel distance nor
persistence of migration (Figures 1C–1E). Next we analyzed
Srgap2 KD cells in a wound-healing assay, where migration is
inﬂuenced by contacts with neighboring cells ( Figure 1 B).
Despite identical total travel distances,Srgap2 KD cells did not
persistently migrate into the wound as was observed for control
cells (Figures 1F–1H). Thus, srGAP2 regulates cell contact-
dependent, directional persistence of migration in monolayers,
but not cell migration per se.
SrGAP2 Regulates CIL and Restricts Cell-Cell Overlap
through Repulsion
Because srGAP proteins mediate cell repulsion in neuronal cells
(Wong et al., 2001), the loss of contact-dependent directional
persistence might be attributed to defects in this process. We
therefore examined the behavior of sparsely seeded ﬁbroblasts
during cell-cell collision. Control cells underwent proper CIL
characterized by cell repulsion and reversal of migrational direc-
tion upon cell-cell collision. In contrast, cells treated withSrgap2
small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were
CIL deﬁcient, because they neither repulsed each other nor
reversed the direction of migration after collision (Figures 2A–
2C; Movie S1). Quantiﬁcation of the cell-cell collision-dependent
change of migrational direction revealed that control cells
migrate in the opposite direction, whileSrgap2 KD cells continue
to migrate with little deviation from their original direction (Fig-
ures 2D and 2E). Additionally,Srgap2 KD cells remained in con-
tact for longer time periods compared to control cells, further

indicating that srGAP2 controls cell-cell repulsion (Figure 2F). We
obtained similar results in primary mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
(MEFs) (Figures S1A–S1D).
We then produced ﬁbroblasts stably expressing Lifeact-GFP
or Lifeact-mCherry, which visualizes F-actin dynamics (Riedl
et al., 2008) and properly outlines the cell border ( Figures
S2A–S2C). This allowed us to unambiguously evaluate cell-cell
overlap in differentially labeled, adjacent cells. Unexpectedly,
we found control cells to markedly overlap. This cell-cell over-
lap, however, increased inSrgap2 KD cells (Figure 2G; Movie
S2). Moreover, cell-cell overlap was stable in time in control
cells, but rose constantly inSrgap2 KD cells (Figure 2H). Cell
size itself did not impact on cell-cell overlap given the weak
correlation between both parameters (Figure 2I). Srgap2 KD,
Lifeact-GFP cells embedded in conﬂuent Lifeact-mCherry
monolayers revealed increased cell-cell overlap compared to
control Lifeact-GFP cells (Figures 2J and 2K). Identical results
were observed in the converse experiment. Furthermore,
Srgap2KD in both the monolayer and the embedded cells led
to a further increase in cell-cell overlap, indicating that both
interacting cells determine the degree of cell-cell overlap.
Importantly, we found thatSrgap2 KD did not affect spreading
in subconﬂuent ﬁbroblast (Figure 2L), indicating that srGAP2
only functions in the context of overlapping cells. This also
was observed in primary MEFs (Figure S1E). In summary,
srGAP2 regulates cell repulsion by maintaining the size of cell-
cell overlap regions constant, both in sparsely seeded contact-
ing cells and in conﬂuent monolayers of immortalized and
primary mouse ﬁbroblasts.
Cell-Cell Overlap Zones Are Constantly Explored by
Dynamic Contact Protrusions
We then explored which mechanism regulates the maintenance
of steady-state cell-cell overlap. This implies the formation of
protrusions crawling either below or on top of neighboring cells
(Figure 3A). To discriminate between both possibilities, we
imaged adjacent Lifeact-GFP and Lifeact-mCherry cells. We
found the following: (1) cell-cell overlaps consisted of multiple
contact protrusions characterized by highly dynamic lamellipo-
dia and ﬁlopodia, as compared to contact-free edges (Figure 3B;
Movie S3); (2) total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence (TIRF) imag-
ing revealed that these contact protrusions remain associated
with the extracellular matrix while inﬁltrating below neighboring
cell edges, which become displaced from the TIRF ﬁeld (Fig-
ure 3C); this is a stereotypic behavior observed in 100% of
cases analyzed (>100 protrusions); and (3) contact, but not
contact-free, protrusions displayed an intense F-actin band
directly at their tip that assembled as soon as contact protru-
sions extended beneath adjacent cells and disassembled
instantly during edge retraction (Figures 3D–3F; Figures S1F
and S1G;Movie S4).
Kymograph-based quantiﬁcation of edge dynamics revealed
that contact protrusions were more dynamic than contact-
free protrusions (Figure 3G), due to not only enhanced mem-
brane protrusion (Figure 3H) but also retraction ( Figure 3I).
Despite such enhanced edge motility in contact protrusions,
there was no effect on net edge movement (Figure 3 J).
Colliding cells undergo repolarization during CIL and establish
new contact-free protrusions away from the site of cell-cell
contact. We compared contact-free protrusions in isolated
cells and in cells engaged in cell-cell overlap and found
that contact-free protrusions in the latter were more dynamic
and persistent than in isolated cells ( Figures S2 D–S2G).
Together, these results show that maintenance of steady-state
cell-cell overlap is mediated by highly dynamic, extending
and retracting contact protrusions with a specialized F-actin
cytoskeleton.
SrGAP2 Speciﬁcally Regulates the Extension Phase of
Contact Protrusions
Since maintenance of cell-cell overlap is a highly dynamic pro-
cess, we explored if srGAP2 regulates contact protrusion dy-
namics. Consistent with the ﬁndings that srGAP2 does not
regulate intrinsic cell migration nor spreading (Figures 1and 2),
we observed that contact-free edge dynamics were not affected
by Srgap2 KD (Figures 3K–3O, ﬁrst and second columns from
left). In contrast,Srgap2 KD increased total and net edge move-
ment as well as persistence of contact protrusions (Figures 3K–
3M). This arose from increased edge protrusion (Figure 3N),
while edge retraction was only minimally affected (Figure 3O).
Protrusion and retraction frequencies also were not affected
(Figures S2H and S2I). Thus,Srgap2 KD enhances the extension
of contact, but not contact-free, protrusions (schematized inFig-
ure 3P), indicating that srGAP2 speciﬁcally limits the extension
phase of contact protrusions.
Endogenous srGAP2 Localizes to Protrusions with
Curved Edges
We then evaluated the subcellular localization of srGAP2 in sub-
conﬂuent, polarized cells. Epiﬂuorescence imaging indicated
leading edge but also perinuclear srGAP2 localization. TIRF im-
aging, however, revealed that srGAP2 speciﬁcally localizes to
the ventral part of contact-free protrusions, with some accumu-
lation at curved cell edges (Figure 4A). SrGAP2 contains a Fes/
CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rversus (F-BAR) domain,
which has been shown to modulate but also might sense mem-
brane curvature (Frost et al., 2008, 2009; Guerrier et al., 2009).
Therefore, we developed an image analysis pipeline to test if
srGAP2 localizes to lamellipodial edges in a curvature-depen-
dent manner (Figure S3A).
This pipeline was validated using synthetic image datasets
(Figures S3B–S3E). By co-labeling of endogenous srGAP2 and
membrane-tethered GFP-CAAX or the transmembrane receptor
Robo4, we ensured that the analyzed srGAP2 signal genuinely
represented the cell edge (Figures S3F–S3K). In srGAP2-immu-
nostained, contact-free protrusions, we detected more srGAP2
at curved cell edges (Figure 4B, left). To quantify the relationship
between curvature and cell edge srGAP2 recruitment, we ex-
tracted srGAP2 ﬂuorescence intensity and curvature proﬁles
along the cell border (Figures 4B and 4C), and we observed a
positive correlation between both variables (Figure 4D). As a
control, analysis of a homogeneously distributed ﬂuorescent
signal from exogenously expressed GFP-CAAX did not lead to
any correlation (Figures 4E–4G). Analysis of multiple protrusions
revealed a distribution shift toward higher correlation coefﬁcients
in cells stained for srGAP2 compared to GFP-CAAX (Figure 4H).
These data show a correlation between lamellipodial srGAP2
recruitment and edge curvature.

SrGAP2 Dynamically Associates to the Tip of Extending,
but Not Retracting, Contact Protrusions
Next, we studied srGAP2 dynamics in contact-free and contact
protrusions. As for its endogenously expressed counterpart,
exogenous srGAP2-GFP localized to the leading edge of single
migrating cells (Figure S4A). Examination of interacting cells re-
vealed that srGAP2-GFP formed a broad gradient in contact-
free protrusions (Figures 4I and 4J;Figure S4B; Movie S5), while
it localized at a focused band directly at the tip of contact protru-
sions (Figures 4I and 4K). The latter pattern was reminiscent of
the focused F-actin signal previously observed at that location
(Figures 3C–3E). SrGAP2-GFP enriched at the edge of growing
protrusions in a curvature-dependent manner and dissociated
from the cell edge during protrusion collapse (Figure 4L; Figures
S4C–S4E). Enrichment of srGAP2-GFP in both contact-free and
contact protrusions required the presence of the F-BAR domain,
because deletion mutants localized to the cytosol like GFP.
In contrast, mutation of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain
(W765A mutant), responsible for interaction with Robo (Guerrier
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2001), did not interfere
with membrane targeting (Figure 4M; Figure S4F). Thus, srGAP2
dynamically associates with the cell edge at the tip of extending
contact protrusions in an F-BAR-dependent manner, but disso-
ciates during membrane retraction.
The Slit-Robo Pathway Regulates Maintenance of
Cell-Cell Overlap and CIL
In neuronal cells, srGAP proteins mediate cell-cell repulsion
downstream of Slit and Robo (Wong et al., 2001; Ypsilanti
et al., 2010). To explore whether Slit and Robo regulate repulsion
in ﬁbroblasts, we designed a robust assay to evaluate cell
contact-dependent spreading in response to siRNA perturba-
tions (Figures 5A–5D). Speciﬁcally, we evaluated if cells deﬁcient
in the repulsion machinery would spread more efﬁciently due to
impaired sensing of repulsive cues received from the monolayer.
Using this assay, we conﬁrmed thatSrgap2 KD cells displayed
higher spreading than control cells in wild-type (WT) cell mono-
layers and vice versa, this effect being further increased in
Srgap2 KD monolayers (Figure 5E). This showed again that
srGAP2 solely regulates cell spreading inﬂuenced by cell-cell
interactions.
Next we identiﬁed mediators of cell-cell repulsion at each level
of the Slit-Robo signaling pathway using siRNA pools.Srgap1,
Robo3, Robo4, Slit2, andSlit3 KD fostered contact-dependent
cell spreading and phenocopied Srgap2 KD (Figures 5F and
5G). We excluded off-target effects by repeating the assay
with single siRNAs for selected genes (Figure 5H). We also
conﬁrmed that Robo4 and Slit2 KD increased cell-cell overlap
in cell monolayers (Figures 5I and 5J). We then examined the
subcellular localization of Slit2 and Robo4 by immunoﬂuores-
cence in subconﬂuent, polarized cells. Both Slit2 and Robo4
localized mainly to perinuclear endomembranes, most likely cor-
responding to secretory compartments necessary for secretion.
TIRF microscopy, however, revealed broad accumulation of Slit2
at the leading edge, while Robo4 was evenly localized at the
plasma membrane with additional enrichment directly at the
leading edge (Figure 5K).
Finally, we investigated the impact of Slit2 and Robo4 on CIL in
both NIH 3T3 cells and primary MEFs. As observed forSrgap2
KD, Slit2 and Robo4 KD cells were deﬁcient in CIL, because
they failed to change the direction of migration after cell-cell colli-
sion and displayed prolonged contact duration (Figures 5L–5N;
Figures S1H–S1K). These results indicate that the receptor-
based repulsion machinery is pre-polarized in contact-free pro-
trusions prior to any cell-cell encounter and activated during CIL.
Construction of a Rac1 FRET Biosensor
To analyze the spatiotemporal regulation of Rac1 by srGAP2,
we constructed an improved, second-generation Rac1 FRET
biosensor, which we term Rac1-2G. We used our previously
described cpFRET toolkit (Fritz et al., 2013), and we took advan-
tage of the GTP-Rac1-sensing domain from the effector PAK1
(Lamarche et al., 1996). The cpFRET toolkit is a biosensor library
in which geometric diversity has been built into the ﬂuorophores.
This library is screened to empirically identify a biosensor with
robust spectral properties. We used a biosensor design that pre-
viously successfully yielded an improved RhoA biosensor and at
the same time retained interaction with RhoGDI, which is essen-
tial to capture faithful spatiotemporal patterns of Rho GTPase
activity (Fritz et al., 2013). We identiﬁed a biosensor that dis-
played a robust change in emission ratio (ER) (Figures 6A and
6B; Figures S5A–S5C and S6) and appropriately responded to
mutations that affect nucleotide loading (T17N) or the ability of
Rac1 to interact with the PAK effector domain (Y40C) (Lamarche
et al., 1996; Figure 6C). The biosensor also adequately re-
sponded to coexpression of RhoGDI and Rac1-speciﬁc GEFs

and GAPs (Figure 6D; Figures S5D and S5E). Expression of the
Y40C Rac1 mutant biosensor, in which biosensor distribution
is preserved, yielded a ﬂat ER proﬁle (Figures 6E and 6F). This in-
dicates that the biosensor faithfully reports on Rac1 activation
dynamics independently of cell geometry. As shown before
(Kraynov et al., 2000; Kurokawa et al., 2004), evaluation of
Rac1-2G in motile ﬁbroblasts revealed that Rac1 is activated in
a broad gradient spanning several micrometers from the pro-
truding cell edge inward the cell (Figures 6G and 6H; Movie
S6). Rac1 activity then ceased immediately during edge retrac-
tion. Together, the robust spectral properties of this second-
generation biosensor reduce phototoxicity and photobleaching
and allow for monitoring of Rac1 activity in time and space.
Rac1 Activity Peaks at the Tip of Contact Protrusions
The existence of speciﬁc morphodynamics and a specialized
F-actin cytoskeleton in contact protrusions suggested distinct
modes of spatiotemporal regulation of Rac1 in contact versus
contact-free protrusions (Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004;
Ridley, 2006). As shown above, evaluation of Rac1-2G in con-
tact-free protrusions revealed broad Rac1 activation gradient di-
minishing from the cell edge to the cell interior (Figure 7A; Movie
S7). In contrast, Rac1 activation was speciﬁcally restricted to a
focused band at the tip of contact protrusions (Figures 7B and
7C; Movie S8), a pattern reminiscent of both the robust F-actin
(Figures 3C–3E) and srGAP2 (Figure 4K) focused bands detected
at the same location. Rac1 activity ﬂuctuations at the tip of con-
tact protrusions correlated with protrusion growth and shrinkage
(Figures 7D and 7E). Together, these results indicate distinct
spatiotemporal Rac1 activation dynamics in contact-free versus
contact protrusions that further correlate with their different
morphodynamics.
SrGAP2 Speciﬁcally Regulates Rac1 Activity in Contact
Protrusions
Because srGAP2 bears speciﬁc GAP activity toward Rac1 (Guer-
rier et al., 2009) and because srGAP proteins mediate cell-cell
repulsion in neuronal cells (Wong et al., 2001), we analyzed the
impact of Srgap2 KD on Rac1 activation. Surprisingly, we de-
tected the characteristic Rac1 activity pattern at the tip of con-
tact protrusions in both control andSrgap2 KD cells. However,
while Rac1 activation peaked transiently in control cells, it
persisted for longer times inSrgap2 KD cells (Figure 7F). The
tip-restricted Rac1 activity proﬁles correlated with the above-
described contact protrusion dynamics: control protrusions
collapsed with decreasing Rac1 activity whileSrgap2 KD protru-
sions continued to expand in the presence of sustained, focused
Rac1 activity (Figures 7G and 7H). In contrast to contact protru-
sions, Srgap2 KD did not affect Rac1 activation patterns in con-
tact-free protrusions (Figure 7I). These results show that srGAP2
limits the duration of the tip-restricted Rac1 activity to regulate
contact protrusion collapse.
DISCUSSION
By identifying the Slit2-Robo4-srGAP2 signaling system as a
spatiotemporal regulator of ﬁbroblast CIL, we link extracellular
signaling cues and cell surface molecules to the Rho GTPase-
dependent control of cytoskeletal dynamics governing CIL. CIL
occurs on an hourly timescale and consists of two phases as fol-
lows: (1) a sensing phase leading to protrusion collapse, and (2) a
repolarization phase resulting in change of migrational direction.
At the timescale of minutes, we ﬁnd the sensing phase to involve
stochastic extension-retraction cycles of specialized contact
protrusions, which constantly probe surrounding cells by crawl-
ing under the edges of adjacent cells. While displaying identical
lifetimes as contact-free protrusions, contact protrusions exhibit
increased extension-retraction amplitude, probably to efﬁciently
register repulsive cues in cell-cell overlaps. Contact protrusions
display a speciﬁc tip-localized, focused F-actin band, which
might act as a very robust lamellipodial network that ensures efﬁ-
cient edge extension while squeezing below a neighboring cell.
Our analysis also shows that contact-free protrusions in cells
with cell-cell overlap are more dynamic and persistent than

those in isolated cells. This suggests a mechanical cross-talk be-
tween the cell-cell overlap zone and contact-free edges that
drives the establishment of persistent contact-free protrusions,
ultimately enabling cell repolarization and change of migrational
direction during CIL. Interestingly, such a redistribution of
cellular forces from cell contact regions toward free cell edges
has been reported recently to occur during CIL inXenopus neural
crest cells (Scarpa et al., 2015).
At the whole-cell scale, srGAP2 loss of function suppresses
CIL through abrogation of cell-cell repulsion both in primary
and transformed ﬁbroblasts. At the subcellular scale, srGAP2
speciﬁcally terminates the extension phase of contact, but not
contact-free, protrusions during mutual stochastic sensing.
SrGAP2 contains an F-BAR domain that, contrary to other
F-BAR domains, has been shown to induce membrane protru-
sions rather than invaginations when overexpressed as an iso-
lated domain (Guerrier et al., 2009). We show that srGAP2
dynamically binds to convex extending, but dissociates from
concave retracting, contact and contact-free protrusions in an
F-BAR domain-dependent fashion. The respectively focused
and broad srGAP2 distribution in contact and contact-free
protrusions might be modulated by differences in cell edge ge-
ometry. Thus, the F-BAR domain seems to work as a cell edge
geometry-dependent sensor to dynamically tether srGAP2 to ex-
tending protrusions, ideally pre-positioning srGAP2 for regula-
tion of protrusions in the eventuality of a cell-cell collision.
The ability of srGAP2 to speciﬁcally regulate contact protru-
sions implies that it receives additional upstream inputs, most
likely from the Slit-Robo system, which it interacts with
(Wong et al., 2001) and which is expressed in primary and
transformed ﬁbroblasts. Consistently, we identify multiple Slit
and Robo isoforms to be important for cell-cell repulsion.
Furthermore, as for srGAP2, we ﬁnd that Slit2 and Robo4 are
pre-polarized at the ventral membrane of contact-free protru-
sions in motile ﬁbroblasts. The enrichment of the repulsion
machinery at the leading edge provides an elegant explanation
for the observation that head-to-head collisions are more efﬁ-
cient in eliciting CIL than head-to-tail collisions, as reported in
epithelial cells (Desai et al., 2013) and Drosophila hemocytes
(Davis et al., 2015), although physical coupling of actin net-
works was found to constitute the driving force in the latter
cell system.
In agreement with their localization pattern, Slit2 and Robo4
mediate CIL in colliding cells. Importantly, Slit2 and Robo4
have been found to function as a cognate ligand-receptor sys-
tem in endothelial cells ( Jones et al., 2008). Slit molecules
interact with HSPGs (Ypsilanti et al., 2010). Thus, Slit2 may be
presented to Robo4 in a glycocalyx-tethered form in cell-cell
overlaps, which remains to be investigated. Although we do
not formally show that physical interaction between overlapping
membranes occurs, the fact that depletion of Slit2 or Robo4 im-
pairs CIL strongly suggests that repulsive signals are transferred
between cells in cell-cell overlaps, rather than through long-
range Slit secretion.
SrGAP2 is a speciﬁc GAP for Rac1 (Guerrier et al., 2009).
Intriguingly, we ﬁnd two distinct spatiotemporal Rac1 activation
patterns in contact and contact-free protrusions. As shown
before (Kurokawa et al., 2004), we detect a broad Rac1 activa-
tion gradient in contact-free protrusions. In contrast, Rac1
activity is concentrated in a narrow band at the tip of contact
protrusions. We propose that it might regulate the robust lamel-
lipodial F-actin pool, which also is present at this speciﬁc loca-
tion. The differences in Rac1 activity patterns in contact-free
versus contact protrusions within the same cell suggest that
different GEFs and GAPs may be required to ﬁne-tune the actin
cytoskeleton to yield context-dependent morphodynamics.
This extends recent ﬁndings of context-dependent spatiotem-
poral Rho GTPase activation programs in response to different
extracellular cues (Kutys and Yamada, 2014; Martin et al., 2014;
Pertz et al., 2006).
Unintuitively, srGAP2 loss of function leads to increased pro-
trusion extension without affecting the characteristic, narrow
Rac1 activity band itself. This suggests that an additional GEF-
GAP signaling network shapes this speciﬁc subcellular Rac1
activation pattern through a reaction-diffusion system (Bement
and von Dassow, 2014). The fact that srGAP2 colocalizes with
active Rac1 during contact protrusion extension necessitates
that its GAP activity is not constitutively active. In agreement,
srGAP proteins are held in an auto-inhibited conformation
through interaction between their N and C termini, which might
get relieved through interactions between the SH3 domain and
its cognate ligands (Guerrier et al., 2009; Zaidel-Bar et al.,
2010). We therefore speculate that srGAP2 controls the duration
of the Rac1 activation band by integrating cell geometry inputs
through its F-BAR domain and repulsive inputs from a Robo re-
ceptor by its SH3 domain (Wong et al., 2001). This might provide
an elegant spatiotemporal signaling mechanism to both position
and activate the Slit-Robo repulsive machinery in contact protru-
sions during cell-cell collisions. Additional repulsive systems are
likely to ﬁne-tune mesenchymal cell interactions through control
of Rho GTPases (Astin et al., 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2013; Car-
mona-Fontaine et al., 2008; Huttenlocher et al., 1998; Matthews
et al., 2008; Takai et al., 2008; Scarpa et al., 2015; Theveneau
et al., 2010), and it will be important to decipher if similar spatio-
temporal Rho GTPase mechanisms occur in those signaling sys-
tems during CIL.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Characterization of Rac1 FRET Biosensors by Fluorometry and
Microscopy
Analysis of the ﬂuorescence emission spectra of the Rac1 sensor library, the
different Rac1-2G mutants, as well as Rac1-2G’s responses to GEFs and
GAPs were performed on a ﬂuorometer (Perkin Elmer LS50b). Typically, 23
105 HEK293FT cells were seeded into a 12-well cell culture plate and trans-
fected with 100 ng biosensor, 400 ng RhoGDI or GAPs, and 1,000 ng GEFs
using Metafectene (Biontex). After 48 hr, cells were detached with brief trypsin
treatment and resuspended in ice-cold PBS and cell suspensions were trans-
ferred into a quartz cuvette. Rac1-2G was excited at 460 nm and emission
spectra were recorded from 480 to 600 nm with a step of 0.5 nm. Spectra
were background-subtracted with spectra of non-transfected cells and
normalized according to their spectrum integral. Relative FRET was calculated
by dividing the normalized ﬂuorescence intensity of Venus at its emission peak
(528 nm) by the normalized ﬂuorescence intensity of mTFP1 at its emission
peak (492 nm).
Additionally, the impact of GEFs and GAPs on the Rac1-2G biosensor was
measured by microscopy. Here, HEK293FT cells were transfected as
described above, were seeded into a 96-well plate (Falcon) coated with
10mg/mL PLL, and nine ﬁelds of view were acquired per experiment using a
Plan Apo 103 objective and the Screening Acquisition Module in MetaMorph
(Molecular Devices). The average ratio per ﬁeld of view was than calculated
fromR100 cells.
Microscopy Settings and Live-Cell Imaging
Epiﬂuorescence and TIRF microscopy were performed on a Nikon Ti Eclipse
inverted microscope equipped with a motorized stage, hardware-based auto-
focus, and a TIRF module containing 491- and 561-nm solid-state lasers
(Roper Scientiﬁc). MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) was used to control the mi-
croscope; 440-, 470-, and 565-nm LEDs (CoolLED) were used as light sources
in the epiﬂuorescence imaging regime. Images were acquired with an Orca R2
CCD camera (Hamamatsu) at 16-bit depth. Epiﬂuorescence images were ac-
quired using 103 Plan Apo and 603 Plan Apo VC objectives at binning 23 2.
TIRF images were recorded using a 603Plan Apo TIRF objective. Live-cell im-
aging was performed at 37/C14 C in Ham’s F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented
with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Filter sets (Chroma) were as follows: ET470/40x-
59022bs-ET525/50 m (GFP); ET572/35x-59022bs-ET632/60 m (mCherry);
ET572/35x-59006bs-ET632/60 m (mCherry combined with FRET imaging);
430/24x-Q465L-ET480/40 m (mTFP1); 430/24x-Q465L-ET535/30 m (FRET);
and ET402/15x-89100bs-ET455/50 m (DAPI). Confocal imaging was per-
formed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta scanning microscope. Images were adjusted
for brightness and contrast only using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices).
Ratiometric FRET Imaging and Image Processing
FRET imaging was performed as described previously (Fritz et al., 2013).
Brieﬂy, NIH 3T3 cells infected with the Rac1 FRET biosensor were mixed
with Lifeact-mCherry cells and seeded subconﬂuently to detect contact and
contact-free protrusions in one sample. To assess the impact of srGAP2
KD on Rac1 activation, we used NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing control or
Srgap2shRNAs instead of siRNA-transfected cells to lower cell toxicity. Cells
expressing low levels of the sensor were acquired with a 603Plan Apo TIRF or
603 Plan Apo VC objective at binning 43 4 and 2-min time resolution. Donor
and FRET images were acquired sequentially with exposure times%300 ms.
Processing of epiﬂuorescence ratiometric datasets was performed with the
Biosensor Processing Software 2.1 (Danuser laboratory:http://lccb.hms.
harvard.edu/software.html). Subsequent image analysis was performed in
MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). Ratio images are color-coded so that warm
and cold colors represent high and low biosensor activity, respectively. The
distribution of the biosensor was monitored in the donor channel. To visualize
cell-cell overlap regions, borders of Lifeact-mCherry cells were generated
based on binary images of the mCherry channel (Laplace1 function in
MetaMorph [Molecular Devices]).
Analysis and Quantiﬁcation of CIL
CIL assays were started 48 hr after transfection of NIH 3T3 cells or primary
MEFs with siRNAs. Cells (73 104) were seeded per well of a six-well plate
and allowed to adhere on glass coated with 5mg/ml ﬁbronectin for 3 hr in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml peni-
cillin/streptomycin. Phase-contrast images subsequently were acquired for
20 hr on a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted microscope with a 103 Plan Fluor objec-
tive. Cell nuclei were tracked using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software.
Cells were tracked for equal time periods before and after cell-cell collision to
yield two vectors that allowed for quantiﬁcation of the migrational direction.

Cell displacement vectors are presented as inCarmona-Fontaine et al.(2008).
The length of vectors before collision was normalized and vectors aligned. The
length of each post-collision vector was scaled accordingly to show the rela-
tive cell displacement after cell-cell collision. Contact time was determined
based on images taken in 15-min steps.
Single-Cell Migration and Wound-Healing Assay
All cell migration assays were performed 48 hr post-transfection with siRNAs.
For single-cell migration, 1.53 102 NIH 3T3 Lifeact-GFP/nuclear localization
sequence (NLS)-mCherry cells transfected with siRNAs were seeded per
well of a culture insert (80209, Ibidi) mounted on 24-mm glass coverslips
coated with 5mg/ml ﬁbronectin. Cells were allowed to adhere for 3 hr in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml peni-
cillin/streptomycin before removal of the culture insert and imaging. For
wound-healing assays, 3 3 103 NIH 3T3 Lifeact-GFP/NLS-mCherry cells
transfected with siRNAs were mixed with 1.23 104 untransfected NIH 3T3
WT cells and seeded into one chamber of a culture insert (80209, Ibidi)
mounted on 24-mm glass coverslips coated with 5mg/ml ﬁbronectin. Cells
were allowed to adhere for 3 hr in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
4 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin before removing
the culture insert and introducing a scratch wound with a pipette tip. Cells
were imaged in Ham’s F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS,
4 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin on a Nikon Ti Eclipse
inverted microscope with a 103 Plan Fluor objective. Transmitted light
(binning 23 2) and mCherry (binning 83 8) channels were recorded. A 103
10 low-pass ﬁlter was applied to the mCherry channel to increase signal-to-
noise ratio and nuclei were tracked using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices)
software. Accumulated travel distance and directional persistence were calcu-
lated with the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool 2.0 (Ibidi), and migratory tracks
were generated with Origin 8 software (OriginLab).
Cell Contact-Dependent Cell-Spreading Assay
To measure contact-dependent cell spreading, 1.53 105 untransfected NIH
3T3 WT cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM
L-Glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (complete medium) into a
24-well plate (Genetix) coated with 5mg/ml ﬁbronectin. Cells were centrifuged
at 2003 g for 2 min at room temperature and allowed to form a monolayer for
3h ra t3 7/C14 C. Subsequently, the monolayer was rinsed three times with com-
plete medium and 33 104 Lifeact-GFP/NLS-mCherry cells transfected with
siRNAs were seeded atop the monolayer and cultured for 3 hr in complete
medium at 37/C14 C. In parallel, 53 103 siRNA-treated Lifeact-GFP/NLS-mCherry
cells were sparsely seeded to assess the impact of each siRNA on intrinsic cell
spreading. The monolayer was then rinsed three times with PBS to remove
non-integrated Lifeact-GFP/NLS-mCherry cells and ﬁxed in parallel with the
isolated cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. All cells
were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes). GFP, mCherry, and DAPI images
of/C24 500 cells per ﬁeld of view were acquired using the Screening Acquisition
Module in MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). Per condition and experiment,

Figure 6. Construction and Characterization of a Single-Chain, Genetically Encoded Rac1 FRET Biosensor
(A) Rac1-second generation (Rac1-2G) biosensor architecture. A PAK1-binding domain (PBD) is used to sense Rac1 nucleotide loading status. Rac1-2Gcontains
circular permutation (cp) 227 of monomeric Teal ﬂuorescent protein 1 (mTFP1; FRET donor) and cp229 of Venus (FRET acceptor).
(B) Fluorescence spectrum of active and inactive Rac1 sensor. HEK293FT cells were transfected with Rac1-2G alone (ON state) or in presence of RhoGDI (OFF
state) and measured using ﬂuorometry. Spectrum was normalized by the area under the curve.
(C) Evaluation of Rac1-2G biosensor mutants in HEK293FT cells by ﬂuorometry is shown (n = 3 experiments; Bonferroni multiple comparison test).
(D) Evaluation of Rac1-2G in response to coexpression of upstream regulators in HEK293FT cells using ﬂuorometry. Full-length CdGAP (CdGAP FL) and
the constitutively active, truncated CdGAP (CdGAPDN) can act as Rac1 GAP (Lamarche-Vane and Hall, 1998). p50RhoGAP is a GAP for Rac1, Cdc42, and
RhoA, while Rap GAP is Rap1 speciﬁc. Dbl and Vav1 are Rac1-speciﬁc GEFs, while C3G is a Rap1-speciﬁc GEF (nR 2 experiments; Bonferroni multiple
comparison test).

64 ﬁelds of view were recorded, and only ﬁelds of view with similar numbers of
DAPI-positive cells were considered for analysis to obtain similar cell densities.
Total cell surface per ﬁeld of view was measured in the GFP channel and
divided by the number of NLS-mCherry-positive cells to obtain an average
cell spreading per ﬁeld of view. Contact-dependent spreading in the mono-
layer was normalized by cell spreading of sparse cells to correct for the effect
of siRNA treatment on intrinsic cell spreading.
Correlation Analysis of Cell Edge Curvature and srGAP2 Amount at
the Cell Edge
We calculated a correlation coefﬁcient for the local curvature of the cell edge
and the intensity of the ﬂuorescent signal at the cell edge in that point. To this
end, we developed a MATLAB-based pipeline, which includes the following
steps (Figure S3): image segmentation, boundary extraction, calculation of
the boundary curvature, readout of ﬂuorescent signal intensity at the cell
boundary, and correlation analysis of curvature and intensity. Single-plane
confocal images were segmented based on the image intensity gradient.
The boundary of the cell was then extracted with the MATLAB function
bwboundaries. Points that belong to the border of the acquired image
were eliminated from the cell boundary. The longest continuous curve
representing cell boundary,b was parameterized in the following way:
bðx; yÞ = bðxðiÞ; yðiÞÞ, wherexðiÞ and yðiÞ are x and y coordinates of theith pixel
along the border. This discrete parameterizationb was ﬁtted with the third-
order polynomial spline (spap2 MATLAB function) to obtain a smooth param-
eterizationb = bðxðtÞ; yðtÞÞ. The third-order polynomial spline was chosen to
ensure continuity of the second-order derivatives of the parameterization,
necessary to calculate curvature. The number of pixels ﬁtted with one spline
was typically set to 20. Finally, curvature was calculated according to the
formula

where 0 denotes derivative. Image intensity was read out from the nearest pixel
along the smooth border b. The Spearman correlation coefﬁcient (corr
MATLAB function) was then calculated between the extracted image intensity
at boundary and the cell edge curvature.
For time-lapse data, TIRF images were preliminarily segmented with a
threshold-based ﬁlter (im2bw MATLAB function). The preliminarily segmented
images were used as a mask for an active contour segmentation (activecon-
tour MATLAB function).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with Prism5 software (GraphPad). D’Agos-
tino and Pearson omnibus normality test was used to check for Gaussian dis-
tribution before comparing groups. Datasets containing two groups were
analyzed by two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test (Gaussian distribution) or
by Mann-Whitney test (non-Gaussian distribution). Datasets composed of
three and more groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonfer-
roni multiple comparison tests (Gaussian distribution) or by Dunn’s multiple
comparison tests (non-Gaussian distribution). Sample sizes of sufﬁcient power
were chosen based on similar published research. Experiments were not ran-
domized and investigators were not blinded. Statistical signiﬁcant differences
are reported at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
